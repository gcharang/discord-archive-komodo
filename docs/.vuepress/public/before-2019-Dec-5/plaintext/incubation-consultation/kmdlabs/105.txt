[23-Nov-18 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Nov-18 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_installs htop, kills it all, and `wget`s bootstrap that was __mentioned__ in readme (with no instructions on how to do so) 😝_

🤦 

[23-Nov-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes wont be using the other branches until we need to ... its there to test consensus breaking things

[23-Nov-18 01:53 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[23-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok ^^

[23-Nov-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
kind of ... it places the komodod and komodo-cli in that

[23-Nov-18 01:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, I try to keep my own scripts and auto optims running with lazynode, so I ll just gather info to get it working, as I want to setup and forget mode :p

[23-Nov-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should be that msotly already .. but you can do it how every you like

[23-Nov-18 01:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
some things are out dated and need to be cleaned up such as wallet resetter ..

[23-Nov-18 01:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
few scripts in there I cna remove..

[23-Nov-18 02:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I want to make it so that the coinds have some prints aswell at some point pipeing all to dev null is good to get iguana running but not great fo other uses.

[23-Nov-18 02:05 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - my notary is stuck on CFEKING with 29160 blocks (longestchain advertised at 29510) my staked CFEKING is still downloading - but shows longestchain as 29526

I forgot to change my config ini until just then thoghu 😫

[23-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah a copule of the chains seem to be not exaclty respecting protocol version

[23-Nov-18 02:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only way to make sure right chain is to use connect= on start to 103.6.12.112 as most if not all the blocks are comign from there.

[23-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once its synced, restart without connect=

[23-Nov-18 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that worked for me

[23-Nov-18 02:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
here I didn t check, but it s the KMD that is stuck at 814000

[23-Nov-18 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Nov-18 02:18 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Nov-18 02:18 PM] jorian#4555

[23-Nov-18 02:29 PM] CMaurice#1685

[23-Nov-18 02:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I tested it already ?

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that was a very specific bug that never should ahve even been in this branch...

[23-Nov-18 02:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It was to help james fix somehting on KMD

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
while using the bootstarp is faster we need to make sure staked is not breaking KMD sync...

[23-Nov-18 02:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it need s valid KMD chain

[23-Nov-18 02:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
