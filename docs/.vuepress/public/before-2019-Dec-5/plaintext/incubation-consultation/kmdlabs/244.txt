NN shows LABST on 157.

[25-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
I'm going to put a mini on it

[25-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
please stake STAKED4 if you can

[25-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
careful with your keys though 😛

[25-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
stake the STAKED4 that was airdropped to LABST that is

[25-Jan-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
well something seems horribly broken for Crish to be having that many rejected blcoks

[25-Jan-19 03:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so please wait until i check it

[25-Jan-19 03:11 PM] CrisF#3405
Stopped 'mining' and tried staking.  Blocks moving now. ```03bb978146eff37bf29c1ceb93ee7dfa8960aa533d25015affa30c07370f5767 mined LABST block 159!
```

[25-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think mining the diff is juist too high

[25-Jan-19 03:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It should not be trying to submit invalid blocks though

[25-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that seems a bug... put all my 8 cores on it...

[25-Jan-19 03:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
see if it happens here

[25-Jan-19 03:12 PM] CrisF#3405
I had 6 on it.

👍 

[25-Jan-19 03:17 PM] CrisF#3405
I was able to `getblock` and check the raw transaction for that staked transaction.

[25-Jan-19 03:18 PM] CrisF#3405
NN blocks moved forward after stopped trying to mine on the other node and started staking.

[25-Jan-19 03:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Have another node up and will try mining on that.

[25-Jan-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I am mining here, but I need you to stake enough blocks to bring the difficulty down... that error is not happenign for me unfortunatly

[25-Jan-19 03:25 PM] CrisF#3405
staking now.

[25-Jan-19 03:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im mining blocks now no errors

[25-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
WOW thios chain is going mental

[25-Jan-19 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
On 2nd mining node said I mined block, but no getblock.  blocks moving forward.  Very occasional `slow_checkpow` in debug.  But basicaly moving forward quickly.

[25-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
40 blocks in seconds

[25-Jan-19 03:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its moving so fast it cant find valid blcoks all the time

[25-Jan-19 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Flying along, eh.

[25-Jan-19 03:30 PM] CrisF#3405
Must have just needed that bit of staking.

[25-Jan-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah you must have put on a decent amount of staking weight

[25-Jan-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at least compared top what it was

[25-Jan-19 03:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
diff will adjust soon enough

[25-Jan-19 03:32 PM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't so much.  I didn't do so well in PoS64, haha.

[25-Jan-19 03:32 PM] blackjok3r#3181
haha.. I'll try get mine up soon

[25-Jan-19 03:33 PM] CrisF#3405

👌 

[25-Jan-19 03:37 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure what caused it

[25-Jan-19 03:38 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hopefully fresh sync fixes... or at least stops at the block that is breaking it

Did you try to reindex?

[25-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no resync is faster

[25-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
mine was diffrent error message

[25-Jan-19 03:39 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it was "block marked as invalid"

[25-Jan-19 03:42 PM] CrisF#3405
I've lost my NN LABST, haha.  With the NN wallet, will it accept a transaction of 5?

[25-Jan-19 03:42 PM] gt#2812
i got same kmd error, started a bootstrap

[25-Jan-19 03:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
did that work?

[25-Jan-19 03:43 PM] blackjok3r#3181
a bootstrap?

[25-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@TonyL  
P{ushed maybe possible fix to master branch

[25-Jan-19 03:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
try it if you can? before reqync or bootstrap option.

[25-Jan-19 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r sure, let me try - not touched anything yet

[25-Jan-19 03:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
thanks ... just uppgraded out proto version... maybe that will help not sure

[25-Jan-19 03:46 PM] gt#2812
not working yet

[25-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah I'm not sure what it is... could be many things..

[25-Jan-19 03:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I know its not anythign to do with what me and james were messing with yesterday as I didnt merge that to master... doubled checked that already

[25-Jan-19 03:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tht definatly could do this... but the code issnt there.. so I am a bit confused atm

[25-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Alright#0419
what block did it stop at?

[25-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to be a block ... it swhatever blck it was on

[25-Jan-19 03:49 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm rebuilding

[25-Jan-19 03:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just bans all peers and flags every blcok a invalid for me

[25-Jan-19 03:50 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but fresh sync seems tro be working... cant know until tomorrow it will take a hell of a long time to sync on that server

[25-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r did you mess with easy mining code at all?

[25-Jan-19 03:56 PM] Alright#0419
seems it rejects notary mined blocks

[25-Jan-19 03:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm ok thanks for that one... trying to read though the changes

not sure if that has always been there or not

[25-Jan-19 03:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181

no I dont beleive its that... starting komodo with 0 args is printing that KMD is  staked chain... chihc means its initing the wrong pubkeys
