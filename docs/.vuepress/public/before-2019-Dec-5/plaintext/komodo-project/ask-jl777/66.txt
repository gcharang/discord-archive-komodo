certainly you cant have gigabyte blocks with todays internet

[02-Jun-19 06:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but 4MB blocks are the same 4MB, whether they are in normal protocol or segwit

[02-Jun-19 06:12 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just in segwit, you hide 3MB under one shell and only show the other shell containing 1MB and pretend that you didn't put 4MB on the table

Re:regarding the THC upgrade. Is there a wallet that I can practice on today to get a better understanding. Can I import my THC wallet today and see 0 balance?

[03-Jun-19 09:39 AM] SHossain#0007
no

[03-Jun-19 09:40 AM] SHossain#0007
use Agama with RICK or MORTY chain for testing. experience will be same

How many komodo each month do you get for lets say 2000 kmd in your wallet ?

[03-Jun-19 07:42 PM] phm87#7395
2000 × 5% / 12 = around 8.333

I tried importprivkey with Komodo-CLI using my THC private key but I get “invalid private key encoding”. Did I miss a step to encode my private key differently before importing it? How would I do that?

[04-Jun-19 04:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure we even started the chain yet bro 🤷

[04-Jun-19 04:38 AM] jacman#4756
It’s not started yet. I wanted to make sure my wallets worked prior to it. Maybe I should be using Agama. Is it different than Komodo-cli?

[04-Jun-19 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You cant import a key to something that does not exist yet lol

[04-Jun-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it can calculate the address. dexstats.info also has a convert address, where the address is converted without privkey

[04-Jun-19 06:06 AM] hastrup#8742
Hi when dex is up and running. And let's say 50 coins are being trading heavily. You have 50 different coin that needs to be converted into kmd. Do you have to do that manually, or is there a bot for that?

[04-Jun-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
no bot for it yet. assuming there are high volumes trading on the DEX, I can use the DEX itself to convert

thoughts on this? https://bisq.community/t/dirty-btc-coins-on-the-xmr-market/7798  in the context of DEXs and things such as Lightning Network (that might need KYC in the future because, tainted bitcoins) ? I know the SEC recently said something about DEXs from a money transmitter standpoint, but I am still _amazed_ the US government has not [tried to] outlaw DEXs (along with privacy coins) or how they really aren't under mainstream attention yet.... Typically the implications of DEX/Privacy Coins would traditionally be a cause for concern for governments and it has not garnered too much attention, at least in the US.

Dirty BTC coins on the XMR market?
This both serves as a buyer beware and a need for advice.  TLDR: I sold XMR for BTC on bisq, transferred it to 2 different exchanges and both accounts independently got locked in the past 2 months.  Before I hear that I should stay away from exchanges, I know, I know already....

[04-Jun-19 03:40 PM] dan.#2473
i am envisioning KYC btc and then a secondary market for 'tainted' btc

[04-Jun-19 03:40 PM] dan.#2473
both of which will have different values

[04-Jun-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
that is what they want to do, however...

[04-Jun-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
they realize the disaster that would be making it illegal and not being able to enforce it

[04-Jun-19 03:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is no central entity involved, what do they do? prosecute every user? for bartering what they own??

[04-Jun-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
its not like there is any copyright infringement or anything, userA wants to swap coinA with coinB from userB. just exactly what crime can they come up with for this scenario? even if they did make it illegal, the lesson of torrents makes it clear it cant be enforced

[04-Jun-19 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so rather than fight a losing battle, they made it very clear that a non-custodial DEX (which they believe wont be practical) is exempted

[04-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and even a centrally controlled website that just displays things, is ok

[04-Jun-19 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so, given that atomicDEX is in the clear, it is easy to use, and it will be the only non-KYC mandated way to swap, people will use it

[04-Jun-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
and so whatever taintedness they want to enforce, wont matter

[04-Jun-19 03:49 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, it is best to use something like PIRATE where there is no history at all

[04-Jun-19 03:52 PM] dan.#2473
do you think any coins in any analysis that are viewed as tainted, will have to stay in a DEX (and secondary) ecosystem in the future? Assuming a weird dystopian future KYC crypto world

[04-Jun-19 03:53 PM] dan.#2473
it makes sense to me there are going to be separate values placed on the same coin

[04-Jun-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
that would really damage the fundamental value of the currency

[04-Jun-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think for small amounts, it wont be worth enforcing this, but you wouldnt be able to use the govt controlled CEX

[04-Jun-19 08:52 PM] joe2x4#5987
What is your take on the pay to anyone segwit attack. 1. Is it possible?

```The Satoshi v0.5.3 protocol views those P2SH addresses as scripts without any public key (i.e. no signature required to spend them), so they can be spent by anyone. Essentially SegWit transactions as interpreted by the Satoshi protocol, before Core unilaterally decided to softfork the protocol, to be transactions sent to some script that has no protection against anyone spending them....

Thus when the Satoshi v0.5.3 miners decide to force Core to fork-off, they will start spending those to themselves when they win a block and the Core miners will fork-off and the Satoshi miners will not fork off.....

Everyone who has their BTC stored in addresses that begin with 1 will receive a free airdrop of Core tokens when Core is forced to fuck-off (ahem I mean fork-off, lol), in addition to their Satoshi BTC tokens. So then they can sell those Core shitcoins to buy moar real Satoshi BTC. Those who ignorantly hodl their “BTC” in addresses that begin with 3will have their Satoshi protocol BTC taken by the miners and they will only keep their soon-to-be-worthless Core shitcoins.```

with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

I know my question is little strange, but i ask. Many developers developing KMD and KMD assets wallets. Piratechain developing own wallets, Verus developing own wallets, K64 developing own wallets, RFOX.... wouldn't it be easier if example! Chainzilla (and Agama) developing all KMD and assets wallets? More more resources for other developments. Another side, more wallets=more possibility good and bad sides.
