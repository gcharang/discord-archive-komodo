Your first few months on discord are when the community is most vulnerable.  Once the community is up to speed you'll love it.      Small suggestion:

[13-Jul-18 10:12 PM] smellycouch#3071
Most channels have a welcome page with a list of rules and ways to identify scammers

[13-Jul-18 10:13 PM] smellycouch#3071
Ie "Admins on this site will never ask for, offer, or attempt to broker trades of kmd or other crypto"

[14-Jul-18 03:47 AM] Mylo#8306
Can we add restrictions to what nodes can connect in a private and permissioned solution other than .conf settings?

Can CC or daemon be used to verify/execute  upon connection.  Eg CC or cmd line options, CONNECT costs COIN for connecting to join network?

[14-Jul-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can use connect=0 then addnode to only the IP's you want.

[14-Jul-18 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
other than that, you would need to firewall the ports to allow only required IP's.

@jl777c could you please enlighten me on what we re trying to achieve with scaling, as we re spawning lots and lots of chains, what is the purpose. I assume this is linked with the ac_cluster option, but how does the clustering really work, what is the mechanism that will makes it act like the XXXXX chains are not different than just only one ? 
How transacting from one chain to another is done, via atomic swap ? smart contracts ?

It's for educational purpose, and I have to explain this into an upcoming conference, the jumping from one chain to another is a big point I'm not understanding. I understand the clustering, but how, let's say someone from chain A can transact with someone with chain B without acting on the supply, and so, is the global supply linked to the cluster, or on each independent chain of this cluster ?

[14-Jul-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
each cluster builds in the ability to import coins burned from another chain in the cluster

[14-Jul-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so to go from A -> B (both in the same cluster), you first burn (or lock) the coins in A with a destination of B. Then B can verify that this burn on A was dont properly via the MoMoM mechanism (dont worry about details for a high level explanation), so B then creates new coins that match what was burned in A.

[14-Jul-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
reduce A  coin by X, increase B coin by X -> total supply in the cluster remains the same

[14-Jul-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is this burn protocol that is enabled via MoMoM that allows a cluster of chains to act as a single one

Wow ok.. and how fingerprints are sent back to all chains ?

[14-Jul-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is built into the (now extended)notarization process. with each notarization each chain sends in a MoM. That allows the komodod to know and be able to prove all transactions on that chain, and more importantly it can create a MoMoM to also be included in the notarization. This communcation loop is time shifted, so for notarization at time X, the MoM of time X is sent along with MoMoM for time X-1

[14-Jul-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a simplification, but I hope gets the idea across. there are some nice graphics that explain this

[14-Jul-18 11:40 AM] sφldat#8733
And this communication loop cannot create an overflow of resources that could hinder notarization in a long term ?

[14-Jul-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The Notary Node Servers are intend to be run not on just single server, but on multiple as I remember from old conversations as the scaling hit to it.

[14-Jul-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
means each notary node operator will most probably have to manage multiple servers.

[14-Jul-18 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
number of notaries will remain same. 64. it's just the resources will be divided into more servers for each.

@jl777c the scammer’s name is now “pistdov” just so you know.

[15-Jul-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
you could make a custom eval function that queries oracles and controls behavior based on that

[15-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Mylo#8306
EVAL function also on blockheight or any other evaluation (even centralized feed) and then execute accordingly.  CCs don't happen automatically, they must be triggered by a transaction to set them "live" from what i understand.  once they have been started, then the blockheight example will check every block to see if it has the right conditions to be executed.

[15-Jul-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it does require writing custom functions, but in theory most anything is possible. we are working on a demo of a simple card game as a first step to better understanding the things needed to make CC easier to use

[15-Jul-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, the custom function is part of the consensus rules as all nodes need to validate the outcomes

[15-Jul-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
writing consensus code is not for weekend coders, that only leads to troubles. I think we will need to make working templates and then allow people to tweak the parameters and not have to do actual coding. even that is pretty dangerous

🙏 

[15-Jul-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
anyone can create a new chain with buggy code, but whether people would actually use it, that is up to them

[15-Jul-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
remember each custom eval is embedded in a specific independent chain

[15-Jul-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
being an independent chain it is independent of all the other chains

[15-Jul-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can destroy itself and no other chain would even know

[15-Jul-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well, i guess if you were doing atomic swaps with that chain, that is the only impact

[15-Jul-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
code isolation

[15-Jul-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
having a system that allows anybody to deploy code that affects everybody... this is pretty brave (or insane)

[15-Jul-18 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
presumably all the chains in the cluster are running the same contracts, so a bug in any one of them is a bug in all of them anyway

[15-Jul-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
though I guess it is possible to run a different set of contracts on different chains in the cluster... so yes, at scale we end up with interaction issues

{Reactions}
✔ 

[15-Jul-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working on limited life contracts, so maybe things can be setup so it expires. that would avoid the need for hardforking to change an existing one. but if a chain wants to hardfork, it can and since it is independent...

Main chain with side chains each with their own sandboxed contract.

It's like the principle arounf microkermels.

with the one time signatures you need to be really careful with IOTA, and also make sure to use high entropy passphrasess

[25-Jul-18 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe an different kind of question, but you see people talking/writing about blockchain 1.0; 2.0 and 3.0 . 
What is this exactly and how are the current developments regarding cryptoconditions and MoMoM testing falling under these categories?
I assume blockchain 1.0 is just your 'regular' blockchain, 2.0 are smart contracts? What is blockchain 3.0?

[25-Jul-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
