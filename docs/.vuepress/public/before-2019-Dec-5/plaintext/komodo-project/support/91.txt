ARRR does not have a lite mode

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'm assuming it's the spv srvs that got derped so arrr is safe

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] criptobear#6402
so useless to move ARRR?

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[05-Jun-19 02:21 AM] SHossain#0007
no need

[05-Jun-19 02:22 AM] LoPhatMelk#9055
but we have cannons!

[05-Jun-19 02:22 AM] criptobear#6402
but if you import the seed in another wallet is not a problem?

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] BTC-BTC-BTC#4223
Create a new address and wif? Don't use seed anymore?

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
@criptobear the point is to move funds quickly

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] allbits#5898
Verus wallet ok on same computer where agama is installed?

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
I would just send to exchange first then take my time to install the correct wallet

[05-Jun-19 02:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
assume that seed is compromised, the sooner u move funds to paper wallet or native the better

[05-Jun-19 02:24 AM] criptobear#6402
@mrlynch ok but once you imported the seed you are not vulnerable even on the other wallet?

[05-Jun-19 02:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'm assuming the seed from agama is vulnerable regardless of what u use rn

[05-Jun-19 02:25 AM] allbits#5898
Verus wallet ok on same computer where agama is installed?

[05-Jun-19 02:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
bugs don't move from wallet to wallet through the seed

[05-Jun-19 02:25 AM] criptobear#6402
ah so the seeds were not exposed?

[05-Jun-19 02:25 AM] zaius333#5338

seed == 24 words (recovery key, or whatever you want to call it) - i don't have any info and don't want to talk outta my ass but i'm **assuming** the spv servers with which agama interacted got compromised therefore seeds are to be presumed compromised as well

[05-Jun-19 02:27 AM] SHossain#0007
Use Verus version of Agama -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
0. Start VRSC Lite mode
1. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)
2. Start the Agama you have been using (0.3.5 or 0.3.6b) then login using your old seed to send funds to the new address you created 
3. Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] AkiraX#8269

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@mrlynch if someone would tell us dafuq is going on, then there'd be no need to assume anything 🤷🏽

💯 

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] AkiraX#8269
Just need to move address?

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] AkiraX#8269
Still use agama or no?

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Nhinestreams#2797
Maybe telling us whats going on makes us more exposed than right now

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Nhinestreams#2797
just gotta trust them

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] mrlynch#5735
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 let them deal with it, whatever it is.. we have simple instructions to follow now... move funds

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Vertigo#0439
I'm keeping mine on bittrex for the meantime

[05-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Exile13#4458
@AkiraX native yes, lite no

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Nhinestreams#2797
Anyone able to connect to a server in Verus though?

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] SHossain#0007
@Nhinestreams which server Verus wallet is not connecting?

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] richardt#2807
What if you created a wallet in native mode, but used a pin password for login with the most recent agama?

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] AkiraX#8269
Isn't everything on mobile agama lite?

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] criptobear#6402
that's why recently the servers spv were being capricious? somebody was hacking them, this means that komodo now is a target therefore we are acquiring importance LOL you know your value when they try to rob you.

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`we have simple instructions to follow now... move funds`
simple if you only use 1 address for 1 coin

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Petrus#8039
@SHossain  electum 1 and 2

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] SHossain#0007
which coin?

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] DLT Novice#2835
Is there an explanation of the error?  I made my own seed,  over one year ago and only login every month to claim interest,  does this effect my seed from years ago

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Petrus#8039
@SHossain kmd

[05-Jun-19 02:29 AM] criptobear#6402

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Vertigo#0439
But the price action was so nice lately

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] SHossain#0007
use Verus Lite mode

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] zaius333#5338
So what do I do if my coins are stuck?

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] mrlynch#5735
`simple if you only use 1 address for 1 coin`
better get cracking then

[05-Jun-19 02:30 AM] CheeseBaby#1954
is it even worth moving BNTN?

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] Petrus#8039
@SHossain i am using lite mode verus, not working: KMD SPV server electrum1.cipig.net:10001:tcp is unreachable!

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] criptobear#6402
for sure there will be some FUD but if the team puts out on social an alert with clear instructions, dumbproof, for putting the funds in a safe place, people will recognise they did the right thing IMHO

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] Nhinestreams#2797
@SHossain what @Petrus said

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] SHossain#0007
hold on

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] SHossain#0007

[05-Jun-19 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so 0ne notice says 2 months, one says 3, one says 4 is ok
does anyone *actually* know what dafuq is going on? 😣

[05-Jun-19 02:32 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`better get cracking then`

If you are using Agama version 0.3.4 and can't sent funds out, use this guide. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama
Or use, Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/

[05-Jun-19 02:34 AM] zaius333#5338

[05-Jun-19 02:35 AM] richardt#2807
@SHossain Are the pin passwords created in the latest Agama compromised as well?

[05-Jun-19 02:35 AM] SHossain#0007

If i always only use native mode, I'm safe? I created a lite wallet seed last year to create a verus address but thats since been moved to a different computer. I only use native. I'm good?

[05-Jun-19 02:39 AM] Tek#5253
