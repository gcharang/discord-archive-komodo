hmm...a familiar sounding statement

[04-Apr-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
VBK seems to only allow detection of reorgs, and cant do anything to prevent it. as a 51% protection it seems not possible without any changes to altcoin code. it is 51% attack detection and i guess the exchanges that never make any changes to their code are supposed to all change their code to detect that a 51% attack already happened. Also, BTC is hard to reorg and data that is written once is just as permanent as data written 512 times, the other 511 are spam

also being decentralized and allowing anybody to post VBK notarizations is actually bad from what I can tell as it allows the attacker to simply make a lot of notarizations to notarize the attackers chain. There is no indication this is prevented from the whitepaper and if it isnt in the source code it means VBK can be used to help the attackers do a 51% attack. After all if 300 of the 512 hashes are the attackers blockchain, that must be the right one. this is the fallacy of data aggregation. just doing a tally of notarizations gives no assurance at all to the accuracy. It is much better to have a set of known pubkeys that first agree upon the state of the blockchain, then broadcast that as a proposed notarization, which all nodes verify if it matches the local data. This is far from centralized and in fact it is almost as decentralized as sending out a multisig transaction. Even though only MofN people are signing a multisig, it is still decentralized as all nodes are verifying it is a valid transaction. To look at the limited number of signers and conclude it is centralized is not understanding decentralization.

@jl777c keyboard letting off smoke, please standby

[04-Apr-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
Anyway, my technical assessment so far is that VBK cannot offer any 51% prevention without changes to the altcoin consensus code. it costs a percentage of coinsupply, instead of a fixed amount. And without any 51% prevention, then what is the entire point of VBK? Let us ignore that exchanges wont be modifying their code to detect reorgs as they can likely already tell that a chain was reorged by looking at debug.log where it says that the chain is being reorged. block by block. Let us ignore that the attacker can very likely use VBK to support his attack if anybody actually used this VBK notarization though, so it is probably good that nobody uses the data. Which all means that all these BTC tx serve no purpose at all, even if it was just 1 per block, let alone 512

[04-Apr-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
To make me change my assessment, show me the code that uses the VBK notarizations to stop a 51% attack from happening, without that VBK is just a big giant BTC spam machine

[04-Apr-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
Likely it is closed source as there is nothing that uses the VBK notarizations and how can the altcoin chain know about VBK data if there are no changes to the altcoin codebase?

[04-Apr-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
paycoin and bitconnect as a comparison comes to mind, all unsupportable promises sold to a gullible public giving crypto and in this case blockchain security a bad name, while they blast away blatant misinformation about KMD. I mean comparing dPoW to dPoS??? totally technically inaccurate, but it seems that doesnt matter to VBK

[04-Apr-19 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is very similar to dPoS since the first three letters are the same, since dPoS is pretty centralized dPoW must be. THAT is the level of technical logic that is being used

```my point is much greater security by the much greater number of txns is given```
wrong! 1 is enough, the rest is just spam that prevents the first to even be included in a block in a timely manner therefore rendering it impaired.. claiming that you get 512 tx in a block is a fallacy and even the 1 that actually matters will be severely delayed by the 50k+ txs sitting in the mempool, unless you(or altchains?!) pay high fees which renders it economically flawed

[04-Apr-19 06:47 AM] mrlynch#5735

let us wait for the answer how can the altcoin consensus mechanism be changed without changing the altcoin codebase

[04-Apr-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
is VBK 51% attack detection that can also be done by grepping debug.log?

[04-Apr-19 07:13 AM] LocoMB#8593
I have a hard time understanding why you guys even bother communicating with a literal pile of feces- make him change his avatar if he wants to have replies...
but: he has stated twice that he will only be back once VBK is open source- so if he he can't handle his acolytic fervour and comes back before that, you should treat him accordingly- just my 2cents
on the other hand, competition is good for business, and if the competition is inferior: all the better! just serves to improve the profile and argumentation then..

[04-Apr-19 07:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
avatars are irelevant
you can't have competition in a different type of business, because you're not in it
i would personally just ignore him/she/it but fud and ad hom attacks are not to be taken lightly

[04-Apr-19 07:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
no, I do not think that avatars are irrelevant. they picture something.

[04-Apr-19 07:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
you don't run around with a bare arse in public places either

[04-Apr-19 07:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
regarding the return, he/she/it will probably return when vbk opens an api call or something irelevant with the argument "hey look, it's open source now"

[04-Apr-19 07:18 AM] mrlynch#5735
let's agree to disagree on the avatars, they're not a reflection of one's capability.. poor taste, maybe, but that again is irelevant

[04-Apr-19 07:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
*well, maybe some people go bare arsed in some places, and that is not a bad thing- but certainly running around as a turd lollipop is a nonverbal aggressive gesture, and should be recognized as such

dPoW prevents 51% attacks. VBK at best seems to be able detect that a 51% attack happened

it's similar to ZEN's solution in that it forces an attacker to mine the chain public, but it doesn't seem to do anything to actually stop these reorgs from happening

[04-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
actually there's a nice snippet from their WP about this. They gloss over a major flaw as if it doesn't matter at all. 
```
As such, anyone watching theSP blockchain would see what block(s) are at risk for the fork, how much stronger (or weaker) the current chain is compared to the adversarial party’s chain, and could potentially use some means (like balance-based voting) to invalidate the adversarial chain before it is released to the network
```

[04-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419
this would require a central entity to fix

[04-Apr-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
"use some means"

[04-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Alright#0419

[04-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
-> totally clueless how to do it

[04-Apr-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and why couldnt an attack mine in private and make VBK tx with a third set of hashes

[04-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
how will anybody know what data is correct? couldnt it look like there is a chain fork, when there isnt?

[04-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
letting anybody post notarizations maybe sounds decentralized and good, but it means you cant rely on any of that data

[04-Apr-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and if the altcoin code isnt changed, then how can it possibly "invalidate the adversarial chain" if you can even determine which is the adversarial chain

[04-Apr-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and if attacker just ignores all this and reorgs the chain, what stops that?

[04-Apr-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so with all the money they have, it seems they will get the altcoins to change their code. I wonder if VBK itself uses the data to prevent its own reorg and if isnt protected from reorgs, which VBK data is the one to use?

[04-Apr-19 11:18 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
From an article:

`proof of proof  records snapshots of any given blockchain and embeds them (in an aggregated form) in Bitcoin transactions, allowing the former to inherit the latter’s security characteristics.

These snapshots can be automatically referenced by the protocol in the event of a 51-percent attack to determine the correct chain. The presence of conflicting snapshots for a particular “altchain” triggers early attack detection (EAD) metrics, which warns users about the potential rewrite before they confirm the transaction and updates them when the transaction is safe to accept.` 

sounds like what jl said, only a warning system

[04-Apr-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
It is the most expensive system ever devised to detect that a 51% attack took place, most people just grep debug.log

[04-Apr-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
also, since PoP is fully decentralized, anybody can submit PoP, including the 51% attacker. it seems PoP data can only detect that an attack took place, but not which chain is the attacker chain

[04-Apr-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
until there is some explanation of how VBK prevents a 51% attack, it is not really worth spending much time on as anybody can setup a cron task to monitor debug.log and printout if a 51% attack happened. maybe finding out a bit earlier from the mempool is a bit of extra info, but this seems a million times less value than the cost of BTC spam

[04-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Tek I think @Lumbi lumberscout also started as ETH, so did GLX

[04-Apr-19 11:38 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
`9.1    Integrating with VeriBlockA blockchain securing with VeriBlock would use a provided library to track VeriBlock and Bitcoin consensus automatically, and then would change their block format and reward structure slightly to accommodate and reward PoPminers, and update the rules of their network consensus to query the VeriBlock library when resolving forks.`

So a little change in the code is necessary to use VBK

[04-Apr-19 11:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
`VeriBlock PoW miners automatically follow several simple aggregation rules to provide summaries of published data (ordering PoP transactions based on a prefix of the published data, which groups all potentially-relevant information for each network together). Additionally, VeriBlock is designed to provide easy subscriptions to early attack notifications on any SI blockchain of interest. This provides an environment where a merchant, exchange, payment processor, etc. has one place (VeriBlock) to acquire security information about all of the blockchains they are interested in, making secure integration with third parties incredibly simple.`

For just a warning system...

[04-Apr-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
as opposed to dPoW that actually prevents 51% attacks and checking that "confirmations" is > 1 is all you need to do to know it is notarized

[04-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Additionally, they claim it's decentralized because anyone can mine it. But anyone can mine bitcoin, but in reality, how many entities are really mining btc?

[04-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
more or less than 64? 😃

[04-Apr-19 11:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
how many pools will exist for VBK?

[04-Apr-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct btc mining with how many pools share the power of decentralised miners

[04-Apr-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the decentralization allows the attacker to mine PoP blocks

[04-Apr-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can count them on one hand.

[04-Apr-19 11:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's how much controls btc

[04-Apr-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is order(s) of magnitude less of a solution than dPoW, but miners are buying in at $50 mil+ marketcap

[04-Apr-19 11:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
