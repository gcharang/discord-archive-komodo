Why does the dex wallet have so much SUPERNET and HODL? in it?
https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php?address=RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf
I assume its not from collected fees?

correct. it is its working capital

if you look at how SuperNET ecosystem and its assets are structured, it looks a lot like it was modelled like  a Keiretsu

KMD is a top-level partner with AWS, sounds like good news for KMD

[01-May-19 01:57 PM] Regnar#6164
I would say it's good news if Amazon considers Komodo one of the frameworks to build on like they are considering hyperledger and ethereum.

[01-May-19 01:57 PM] Markus#5464
how likely is that to happen tho

[01-May-19 01:57 PM] Markus#5464
if that happens then ofc its huge

[01-May-19 01:58 PM] Regnar#6164
Well as Duke mentioned, Komodo is one of the top tiered technology partners on AWS. So I'd say it's definitely possible.

Is there a lobbyist from kmd to help AWS make the "right" decision?

[01-May-19 03:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
not sure you understand

[01-May-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
AMZ is in the business of selling servers and bandwidth, they don't take sides on things like coins, the "right" decision for them is to sell services to everybody

[01-May-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
they see blockchain stuff as a new startup industry

[01-May-19 03:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
so now they are specializing their AWS offerings for it, to make more money

[01-May-19 03:46 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD already is a partner with AMZ, so is well-positioned to take advantage of AMZ expanding their blockchains-as-a-service business

It takes long time 3-4 hours

[01-May-19 11:48 PM] Alexfrog#1338
It wont give any indication that they've received a transaction for hours, and then after you give up and check back later itll be there.

[01-May-19 11:51 PM] Equihashing Anonto#6242
Ohh! I see. Thanks for the information @polycryptoblog  hi by the way @Alexfrog  your message is not clear to me. You mean to say email notifications or what?

[01-May-19 11:52 PM] Alexfrog#1338
no, went i sent some there, for many hours it didnt have any notice that i had made a deposit.  no confirming or anything.  I almost made a support ticket. Then later, it was there.

[02-May-19 04:34 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
You can use Windows portable version. Next release in a week or two I think

[02-May-19 06:41 AM] Alexfrog#1338
what does the 'portable version' mean

[02-May-19 06:57 AM] dwarrel#2511

portable means you don't have to install , just extract the files and run it

Anybody use voat.com instead of reddit? Reddit has gone crazy with new rules, white lists, bans, and general censorship. The only thing we can discuss there is top 50 coins (even in r/altcoin!) and the only things that seem to be allowed through are projects the mods own. Voat seems to be open to discussion and free speech.  I did find quite a bit of racism unfortunately but I'm chalking that up to the double edge nature of free speech. At any rate, if more and more people get fed up and leave reddit for Voat (that's why they formed) then it can be a good opportunity for the smaller projects who already got there first. Just another angle to consider and considering the aim is to reach your user base, why not exhaust all avenues along the way?

@Mr.Cryptodude we are internally testing the last implemented features (that are payment & dPoW integration, automagic wallet and DEX listing) - we going to publish a comprehensive community update for CL and for the mobile DEX wallet the coming week - both products are in alpha testing and about to go into final revision before public beta program announcement.

how these companies structure, make revenues, etc, this is beyond the scope of komodo open source project

already there are various closed source things made by ecosystem projects, which is their right to do as long as it is following the licenses
