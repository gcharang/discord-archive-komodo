@Alright "coding is the opposite of "color within the lines" Usually coding and formal math is about coloring in the lines created by a design of some sort. I'm sure JL777 for instance does design and also coding, which is great. Some only do coding and don't design. I'm more interested in the design than how to make it happen. For instance, I'd rather be an architect than a construction worker, or a director rather than an actor. Coding is fun for some people and not fun for others, same with construction and acting. That's fine, we should all do things we like. I'm not criticizing coding at all, each type of work contributes to the overall project.

[15-Jan-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
to me coding is like writing a  novel, just where if you dont have the syntax 100% correct, you cant even printout the book. Even if it prints, it might be a "bad" story. The "story" is told by the specific "words", the "design" and "coding" to me is one and the same, though there are the higher level aspects like what rpc calls to make and the general functionality, 99% of the work is in writing and debugging the words. However I do incremental development process where I evolve the code to be more and more complex, starting from the simplest. This way, I stop when the problem is solved and likely have the simplest solution that solves the problem. Designs by non-coders is apt to be as useful as code by non-coders, it is all about the details

[15-Jan-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of times, the design comes out of the lower level code as any solution usually has certain low level aspects that need to be there. so before there is any full design, you can start writing the low level code you know will be needed and that reduces the variables in the design

[15-Jan-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
similarily you can start designing the highest level aspects that you know must be there and this drives the required lower level code

[15-Jan-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
as the lower level code becomes higher level and the design gets more detailed, they meet somewhere in the middle

[15-Jan-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810

Store coins yourself. You fight hackers yourself, and guard from losing wallet yourself. Computer breaks, USBs gets lost.

Store on an exchange.  Only use the most reputable, proven secure, exchanges.

Or move to DEX, disrupt ourselves. https://t.co/Ci4ux9I3VD

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `Then no technical aspect of crypto is likely for you; it's literally all about math`

As @grewalsatinder said, literally everything is related to math in some way. Math is like the 1s and 0s in computing. It doesn't mean you need to know how the 1s and 0s work in order to code. In the same way, I don't need to know every tiny technical aspect in order to contribute. Even in math there is informal and formal math. I recommend the movie "The Man Who Knew Infinity" about Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (yes I had to copy-paste it), but his wiki is a good summary: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan

`Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered". [...] However, [...] in his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy stated had "defeated [him and his colleagues] completely", in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.`

`Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.`

Ramanujan wasn't big on formally proving his work, even though a lot of it was formally proved in the end. What's my point? Some people like formal work, such as accounting, and other people like informal work, like art, while still others like both. Nothing wrong with it, and we need both types of work. Too much formality is too time and energy intensive, while too much informality leads to mistakes and faulty assumptions.

Actually, it does
You may not need to know the math to be a blind end-user using some grandma-friendly GUI, but if you want to do anything in this space, it requires math

@jl777c `to me coding is like writing a  novel, just where if you dont have the syntax 100% correct, you cant even printout the book. Even if it prints, it might be a "bad" story.`

I agree it is like a novel. Only, what I don't find fun about programming is how how "picky" the readers are, resulting in a bad story. As you say, the syntax has to be 100% correct. Most natural language is informal and subjective, yet people understand most of what you say. This can be good and bad, as stated above. A lot, if not most, human disagreement I believe is due to us not using some type of formal language to get our points across, however getting those points across would be very very tiresome.

Programming languages right now are too formal for me to like it. As time goes on, these languages will most likely become more and more informal to the point where natural language can be translated to code more efficiently and accurately. It can never be as efficient as lower level languages, and it will take work, but it will get better as time goes on I assume. 

At some point I may enjoy coding, when I don't have to make sure every little thing is in its proper place in order for it to compile, which drives me nuts. I don't have the patience for it. When I write, all I have to think about is how to structure an article in a way that makes sense to the reader.  Programming languages at the moment are like *very* picky readers who won't even read what I wrote unless my sentences are structured in a certain way. Or to an artist it would be like if colors could only be in certain geometric patterns or something. It can't be an estimate of what "looks right" or is subjectively pleasing to the eyes, but a set of rules the art must abide by. I could never write or create art like that, personally.

[15-Jan-19 02:57 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Human subjective thought is probably the most informal experience we have, and it's really what I enjoy most. Then there are lower levels of expression that get more and more and more formal, which I find less and less and less fun.

As another example, people who play video games have different difficulty thresholds for maximum enjoyment. For some it is low and find games like Dark Souls too difficult to be fun, while other strive off of the difficulty. Some push themselves to the max and enjoy personal feats such as climbing Everest, while others wouldn't find that pursuit worthwhile. I feel these differences are very similar to what I'm talking about with formality vs. informality.

Does that help explain where I'm coming from? ❤️

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 `Actually, it does

I'm talking about the literal lowest level binary code most developers don't need to concern themselves with. I used this as an analogy for different levels of formality in life in general. Like I said, I don't find coding fulfilling, nothing wrong with that, but I don't believe it means I can't contribute on a higher level language above programming. Just like Mr. Ramanujan, it just means I can't formally prove anything past a certain point.

Gnosis interests me since it would prevent front running but it will have horrendous scalability since you need to wait in a Dutch auction style for your trade's price to get discovered.  

Hyperdex is a better alternative than barterdex. Clearly preferring it more.

Resistanceio is my final pick since it would be a DAO in future , CPU mineable and adopts zk-Snarks similar to Komodo (with Tor) for privacy.

[15-Jan-19 04:10 PM] Honeybadger#5573
I guess I can also include BNB dex, but that one is using Neo's consensus algo, which is too centralized for my tastes even if it is a good contender for DEX

So Hush is in extreme need of liquidity after Cryptopia (potentially) folding....
Anybody with suggestions / connections that could possibly bundle us on a listing?
We've dove from averaging over $10,000 in daily volume to reaching $500 if we're lucky now that we have no exchange support besides TradeSatoshi...
Hush is an extremely attractive project after adding KMD dPoW, we're just having an extremely rough time with liquidity and hoping the KMD ecosystem can help to support a fellow coin...
Anything is appreciated.

I just suggested yesterday that KMD projects should unite for listing as this is cheaper and may be easier to negotiate if say 10 projects come together to collect 10-15 BTC maybe an exchange would list them all. 10 -15 BTC is still a lot of money, but in case of 10 tokens it's just 1-  1.5 BTC each, so much cheaper then regular 3 BTC. Idk if this is doable for Hush, but I dont have a better idea in the moment.
