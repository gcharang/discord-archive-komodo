not hard to pretend to be someone ur not on the internet

[30-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Markus#5464
look all those ico scams in 2017

[30-Jul-19 01:28 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
but what you say could be true

[30-Jul-19 01:28 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
yes

[30-Jul-19 01:28 PM] Markus#5464
many pretended to be working for large companies aswell

[30-Jul-19 01:29 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
they all had fake Linkedin profiles etc

[30-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Markus#5464
yes

In today news Solana has received 20 millions VC funds, it seems it can scale to 50k tps without sharding with their proof-of-history function: https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274

I wonder if the same VC will take notice whenever the 1 million tps stress test takes place

[30-Jul-19 01:33 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
also, when you click on their Twitter link and visit their Twitter page, the website they have there is another one, for Safecoin, which is confusing:
https://safecoin.org/

[30-Jul-19 01:33 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
you could be right

[30-Jul-19 01:34 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
they don't ask for people's money like ICOs, but it could be that they mine people's data like you said

[30-Jul-19 01:36 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Actually, their Github says they are a fork of Komodo:

ah really

[30-Jul-19 01:37 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
OK 😃

[30-Jul-19 01:37 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
good to know

[30-Jul-19 01:38 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think I should delete this app then

[30-Jul-19 01:39 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
it's not good for Komodo then that they even mention it there

[30-Jul-19 01:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
anyone can fork it. doing something useful is another story. btw I'm not longer seeing it much shilled on twitter like at its beginning

[30-Jul-19 01:42 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
it does say "Copyright Safecoin" at the bottom of the PI website, but the two separate websites and names are confusing. Sorry, no it says "Socialchain".

[30-Jul-19 01:48 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I'm glad I posted about it here
the idea of an app that lets you mine from your mobile could still be good, independently from this specific project

[30-Jul-19 01:52 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
This is who they say is their head of technology. He doesn't mention the PI app on his profile:
https://hci.stanford.edu/nicolas/

[30-Jul-19 01:56 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
If he really is, then it's probably ok. But if they just used his name, then it's a total scam

[30-Jul-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it is technically impossible to mine or even stake if you are not running code

[30-Jul-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you could delegate to another node to stake for you

[30-Jul-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
or it could be a utxo timestamp based rewards mechanism like KMD has

[30-Jul-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but without an initial amount, there is nothing to gain rewards on

[30-Jul-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so a faucet combined with utxo rewards system would be needed

[30-Jul-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
an uncapped faucet would massively dilute any coinsupply, even if it wasnt "staking"

On his profile it says: "Dr. Kokkalis has expertise in designing viral social applications, with apps attracting over 20 million users having exceptional engagement and retention rates, that received the Facebook Fund award in 2009"
I wonder if the app is all about getting to know who your social connections are, then maybe reselling the data

[30-Jul-19 02:10 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
and the video on their site says "allows you to mine on your phone, leveraging your social connections"

[30-Jul-19 02:10 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
doesn't sound good

[30-Jul-19 02:12 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
And I think Apple vets the apps for malware etc, but they would let them in even if they sell people's data

So what is the final verdict? Scam or no-scam? Should I delete the app or keep it?

[30-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Markus#5464
even if its not a scam the coin will never be worth anything

[30-Jul-19 02:15 PM] Markus#5464
waste of time

[30-Jul-19 02:15 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I've "mined" nearly a thousand of them, I don't want to delete it then regret it

[30-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
think about it urself

[30-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
u need to click 1 button per day to get coins

[30-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
that is basically free

[30-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
how is that ever gonna gain value

[30-Jul-19 02:16 PM] Markus#5464
u might get a mc donalds meal per month with it 😄

[30-Jul-19 02:17 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Well, this is their beta. What if one day the coin is used, goes on exchanges etc

[30-Jul-19 02:17 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
At the moment yes, it has zero value

[30-Jul-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
use case of the coin would be what?

[30-Jul-19 02:17 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
NOt sure : )

[30-Jul-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464

ahah!

maybe for sending tips lol

[30-Jul-19 02:18 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
if they sell people's data I'm definetely against using it on my phone

[30-Jul-19 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
and if they didnt do an ico how they gonna get listed on exchanges

[30-Jul-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
i highly doubt such team would pay the fees themselves

[30-Jul-19 02:19 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
yes...and when it's "free", it's usually not "free"

[30-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Markus#5464
if such coin would get listed for free it basically means the exchange got 0 volume

[30-Jul-19 02:21 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
so let's say it's a bad app...what would they gain from getting people to tap every day? Know their location?

[30-Jul-19 02:22 PM] Markus#5464
Dont know

[30-Jul-19 02:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
they're mining your data and giving you a souvenir? would be interesting to try turning off location and any other data you can to see if it effects the mining.

[30-Jul-19 02:23 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
ok

[30-Jul-19 02:25 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
so maybe it's not a full scam, as using fake profiles etc, but could be an unethical app, like having Facebook's app on your phone

[30-Jul-19 02:27 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
their Twitter page looks terrible, low quality

[30-Jul-19 02:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
honestly at least they're giving you something for what they usually just steal. I would prefer even a worthless token compared to what most apps offer, which is nothing

[30-Jul-19 02:35 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
but if they do sell the data, it's almost worst...tricking people into sharing data with the expectation that one day the tokens will be worth something

[30-Jul-19 02:37 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Someone said "you are not searching Google, Google is searching you". In this case it could be the same, just change the word "search" with "mining" basically

[30-Jul-19 04:08 PM] actionslacks#4072
every app maker does it and wall st pays good money for the data. it's innovative if it creates a commodity based on something that was given freely away already. but judging by the hype on /biz/ it's likely just a pump and dump

[30-Jul-19 04:51 PM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I hope not all apps : )

[30-Jul-19 05:23 PM] shak3nbak3#2279
Can any blockchain algorithm be secured with KMD dPoW? like a DAG chain using KMD to secure their network?

hi guys. im considering writing a piece on ``The Trusted Setup``. I think its the one greatest obstacle to greater adoption of KMD and other Zcash forks. Im interested in your opinions on how to best explain/justify/legitimize it use to Trusted Setup skeptics. ty

[31-Jul-19 12:42 PM] gcharang#6833
@gigamesh z-Addresses are deprecated on the Komodo chain

Pirate arr - compulsory z-addresses
Other KMD smartchains - have an option to have private addresses

[31-Jul-19 12:44 PM] gigamesh#3544
> z-Addresses are deprecated on the Komodo chain
really? no anon txns in KMD??

[31-Jul-19 12:44 PM] gigamesh#3544
so there is no Trusted Setup in KMD?

[31-Jul-19 12:47 PM] gigamesh#3544
that cant b right

[31-Jul-19 12:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@gigamesh there were z-addresses on KMD but they are not allowed anymore
the total supply of KMD can be verified on the blockchain to be equal to the total emission

[31-Jul-19 12:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the sapling parameters were generated by 200 partecipants, if someone seriously believes all of  them can be compromised then it logically follows that everything else is likely compromised as well,  including Bitcoin developers or ECDSA. The fact is no one seriously believes that, it's just fud

[31-Jul-19 12:48 PM] gcharang#6833
Also, just 1 honest participant ensures the security of the parameters

[31-Jul-19 12:50 PM] gcharang#6833
by the time they were deprecated, less than 5% of the addresses were using z-addresses on the Komodo chain edit: less than 0.15%
