Everyone forgot why to hold cryptocurrency,we like the technology behind BTC but we do not like the BTC,im Komodo maximalist..... holding your funds is the most precious thing in crypto

Eth was hacked few years ago, ZenCash 51%,verge I don't know if I can call a cryptocurrency but was hacked,you need background in cryptography and time to build something strong

@hardcoree i was thinking the same and i read you. good to tell about that. and trading tools should be better.

[10-Jul-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <joebitcoinorg> I would like to see the ability to run an asset chain with sub-tokens on it.  I envision having thousands of new "coins" per month - mostly with low transaction activity.  This is for the http://RemedyCoin.com project I'm advancing.  Each coin represents the forgiveness of certified damage in someone's life.

[10-Jul-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <joebitcoinorg> I also need a daap to be able to run which obfuscates the ip address of the clients, provides privacy to the organization's data store.

[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> Notary nodes are a different form of self-funding governance. More akin to a republic than a democracy like in dash

[10-Jul-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> You elect the notaries who receive a certain amount of funds from easy difficulty mining.  Typically these notaries received votes based on campaign promises of what to do Funds in excess of labor/hardware/maintenance  .  The difference between the two systems is one you choose a delegate to work in what is in your interest,  the other is referendum.

Hey guys I have a question, how exactly do you go about developing a blockchain with komodo

[10-Jul-18 04:18 AM] Nano#1742
I am looking to create a blockchain and ICO for the tokenization of real-world assets using legally binding smart contracts/POE for asset issuers and holders. I was hoping to find a good platform to develop this blockchain upon thats really time effective because I am limited on funds to develop this with. Would Komodo be a good platform?

[10-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
like not even related to what you'd expect

[10-Jul-18 08:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@1TheGhostProject can you even start to support your position and point to such "attacks", or are you just going by what you read from unSafeCoin fanbois?

[10-Jul-18 08:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
P.S. - mining a coin because the developers have a hardcoded ability for you to do so is not an "attack" nor is clicking a "claim interest" button as many times as it will allow because the "developers" didn't understand the code they commented out and it let you collect every 2 seconds

[10-Jul-18 08:51 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
P.S.S. - **the latter was a private individual and not Komodo**

@jl777c a basic game with guys running around trying to kick a ball

[10-Jul-18 10:00 PM] metaphilibert#0926
but with also a potential impact on History, due to the overwhelming media pressure

[10-Jul-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <polycryptoblog:matrix.org> I thought it was a game where they throw a ball and tackle each other 😂

ex concerning last one, Belgium needs much more than France a unity spirit (Mr Macron who is definitely very lucky would certainly disagree)
we were at a  significant fork in the tree of possibles and i am sure that Belgium and France (and by extension Europe, World and surroundings) History are different depending on... a game with a ball

[10-Jul-18 10:04 PM] metaphilibert#0926
was a pleasure to share your only match this year @SHossain 
i watch it every 4 years (or 2 sometimes), and was more closely following this year, i am still amazed of the mass social effect

[10-Jul-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
