Gui

[09-Oct-18 12:58 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok in my experience it does something strange the GUI somehow connect first I believe with the default seed and than mixes up the addresses i could never reconstruct a proper way how to reconstruct it.
If you are comfy on a linux terminal it it much easier can do  that?

[09-Oct-18 01:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
or let me see if I can help you on windows command with a step by step

[09-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Mark81#4505
Ok i can go through that pain. Probably need to download marketmaker separately. If you can leave here fast instructions and once i have time more at evening I'll go trough it.

[09-Oct-18 01:03 PM] CHMEX#0686
ok will do

[09-Oct-18 01:03 PM] Mark81#4505
Thanks!

[09-Oct-18 01:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/exchanges
nano passphrase   # export passphrase="YOUR PASS PHRASE HERE"
# start marketmaker
./client

# than you should see at some point
# userpass.(cXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxx6)
# copy that one and save it in userpass export userpass="cXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"


#open new terminal

nano userpass

# now drop your claim file from the website in ./SuperNET/iguana/DB/
# than execute 

./claim

#that should claim your deposit.
# if the deposit is exactly 10 KMD you are not receiving rewards as it was to be >10 ( because of trx fee)

#I Hope it helps if not let me know I can claim it for you but I need the passphrase which is not the purpose of this exercise.
#also SHossain has done it for some people if so just make sure it does not have funds in it.

[09-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Mark81#4505
claiming from.(["a2b37954bf89f76ed3349d14318a0b2e93a7ce1475920d9ed932c3fa8e86b042"])
cant get transaction flagi.0

[09-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Mark81#4505
i get that error.

[09-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Mark81#4505
i have checked that funds are on claiming deposit address

[09-Oct-18 02:27 PM] CHMEX#0686
Ok I don't know this error code maybe I can find it in code.
are you on a native or electrum connected machine?

[09-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Mark81#4505
electrum

[09-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Mark81#4505
oh...

[09-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Mark81#4505
it didnt cross to my mind even... how i start from cli electrum mode?

[09-Oct-18 02:31 PM] CHMEX#0686
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data {"userpass":"$userpass","method":"electrum","coin":"KMD","ipaddr":"electrum1.cipig.net","port":10001}"

[09-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Mark81#4505
worked! Thanks @CHMEX  😉

[09-Oct-18 02:33 PM] CHMEX#0686
Indeed!

[09-Oct-18 02:35 PM] CHMEX#0686
you even got reward!

[09-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Mark81#4505
Seems like so. I wonder why?

[09-Oct-18 02:39 PM] CHMEX#0686
There was a time where exactly 10 KMD did not result in receiving the reward because the spend deducated 0.0001 hence <10 but it looks like this is now adjusted. Good news

[09-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Mark81#4505
Well its been sittingbthere since february. Has it anything to do with it.

[09-Oct-18 02:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe yes but I would not know.

[09-Oct-18 02:49 PM] Mark81#4505
HI!

[09-Oct-18 02:50 PM] Mark81#4505
I was wondering if you would have interst to add more coins from komodo ecosystem to that pool? There is already call and mgnx that are mineable.

[10-Oct-18 08:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
there are some guys talking about DEX on twitter, somewhat technical so not sure if I can chime in it

[10-Oct-18 08:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
can FR nodes do fruntrunning?

@decentrali @udiWertheimer Just like relayers get front-runner abilities in off-chain orderbook systems, miners get front-runner abilities in onchain orderbook systems. I think a consensus engine like Hashgraph is necessary for decentralized order matching.

[10-Oct-18 09:02 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I can reply something tomorrow

[12-Oct-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX uses a broadcast protocol so all nodes know about all offers in realtime. seems hard to front run that

[12-Oct-18 08:06 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
understood and replied

[12-Oct-18 08:20 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok he now said "That's only if first-seen rule is honored, and there is currently no proven way to force nodes to honor it"

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
each client sends to multiple FR nodes

[12-Oct-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so, yes the first node could refuse to relay, but it would gain only a few milliseconds advantage and only if they were the first of the N to receive it

[12-Oct-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the protcol extends the time the auction is open for up to 30 seconds with a minimum of 3 seconds

[12-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont think there needs to be any complicated proof that 3 seconds time an order is open for (at minimum) is enough to totally negate any few millisecond advantage the first node gains

[12-Oct-18 08:25 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
thanks, perfect answer

[12-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
who is it that makes these type of "DEX

[12-Oct-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
is impossible to be fair arguments?

[12-Oct-18 08:30 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
he's a developer with quite a following in btc/eth circles

[12-Oct-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so, i wonder how he responds to my 3 seconds is a lot of time compared to a few milliseconds response

[12-Oct-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe I am just not smart enough to understand why it doesnt work

[12-Oct-18 08:37 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'll report what he answers

[12-Oct-18 08:43 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this from a another guy: "what do relay nodes do if there's conflicting info?"

[12-Oct-18 08:45 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
"i.e. 1) sorting of who went first is different from different relayers 2) orders are conflicting for same user (buy 5 AND by 10 but can only afford one of them) "

[12-Oct-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all the requests are signed by the one making the request

[12-Oct-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it is broadcast to all that are online (via redundant relay nodes whose sole purpose is to relay orders)

[12-Oct-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the ones interested respond (with a signed offer)

[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the requestor evaluates all incoming signed offers and accepts the one that it wants

[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt matter who went first

[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
orders cant conflict for the same user, as the utxo needed are specified in the offer. if any detail is different, it is a different offer

👌 

[12-Oct-18 09:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the other guy seems satisfied with the answers, Eric didn't reply

[12-Oct-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so that means I solved another "impossible to solve problem"? without writing a complicated whitepaper, doing an ICO, etc?

[12-Oct-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
If I didnt need the BTC for the KMD notarizations, I wouldnt have had to do that ICO, but I didnt have the few thousand BTC that was needed

[12-Oct-18 09:49 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
the other guy is "Premine apologist" that I often read finding holes and asking hard questions to every projects, if he says "ok I've to think about it" is as good an endorsement as you can get

[12-Oct-18 09:50 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
means he's impressed

wow for once a good article about AS talking about Komodo too

[13-Oct-18 02:47 AM] freakbros#9074

Nice ^^

[16-Oct-18 05:57 PM] barv#0867
But here again they talk about the first atomic swap being decred <> litecoin in nov 2017 between two lead devs. At that time Komodo community menbers (users!) already performed thousands atomic swaps ?!? Are they rewriting history here?

[16-Oct-18 05:59 PM] barv#0867
Or am I 🤔 and is time just passing quicker then i think?

[16-Oct-18 06:21 PM] barv#0867
I see. They do mention "In the beginning, this code only allowed atomic swaps between NXT assets. However, jl777 then upgraded the code to enable NXT assets to be exchanged with any Bitcoin-protocol coins." which was probably around 2015?

[17-Oct-18 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if we dont correct the reporting about the "first" atomic swap, history will be rewritten to the absurd version

[17-Oct-18 07:09 AM] barv#0867
I recently corrected this for the Dutch version of ‘blockchain for dummies’. I happened to bunp into the writer. He also took the Decred nonsense for a true story

[17-Oct-18 07:17 AM] ph03nix#3115
when first atomic swap

[17-Oct-18 07:19 AM] barv#0867
Should be this: I see. They do mention "In the beginning, this code only allowed atomic swaps between NXT assets. However, jl777 then upgraded the code to enable NXT assets to be exchanged with any Bitcoin-protocol coins." which was probably around 2015?

i did some manual bitcoin atomic swaps with KMD in 2016, I just didnt realize I was supposed to make press releases out of it as others already achieved this too

Was hoping to setup KMD/VRSC bob and assume I need to spin up VRSC as an assetchain.   Where might I find the max supply parameter for this coin, assuming I need that to start the chain.

[18-Oct-18 11:10 PM] cipi#4502
```verusd -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_veruspos=50 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -addnode=185.25.48.236 -addnode=185.64.105.111 -daemon```
is what i use on my bob
