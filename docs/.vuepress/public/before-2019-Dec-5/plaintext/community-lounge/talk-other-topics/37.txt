When CZ mentioned Komodo and Cosmos as examples, I had a look at what Cosmos is doing. I understood it has separate zones that interconnect via hubs but I missed how all this is secured, how validators are elected.  It turns out it's almost a permissioned system:

[06-Dec-18 10:54 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
`Design of Cosmos is essentially similar to the Internet. Internet consists of Autonomous Systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet) …), legal entities/companies that utilize BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to route and transfer Internet packages. This system is PERMISSIONED, and Autonomous Systems have to trust each other. This system works pretty well, mostly because there are legal consequences for anyone acting maliciously. Cosmos hubs also need to trust each other, because they can not know what's inside their peers' blocks (they are only each others light clients). That said, Cosmos can work well if we assume it's permissioned, and hubs are (some form of) legal entities and can face legal consequences if misbehave. @zmanian confirmed that they are looking into e-rights as a possible solution for this "legal binding". If we want open/permissioned system which consists of anonymous entities, I argue that Cosmos design is insecure. I'm always happy to be proven wrong, of course. That said, I don't think an Internet-like, permissioned "Internet of Value" is a bad thing. Moreover, I think it's an extremely powerful concept. It might not be as sexy as "open, permissionless global DeFi", but IMHO I think it has at least equal (if not bigger) chances of being widely adopted. I'm still a fan of open systems though, and I hope they will prevail.`

*Of the 400-plus passengers, many—I’d guess at least 150—are “hostesses” from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, and many are offering services unspecified. Most blockchain events have a gender balance problem. The cruise organizers have allowed the decentralized free-market to solve that problem the best way it knows how. Not enough women? Just hire some. Not as actual employees of your company, god no. To stand around looking delicious and fascinated. What else are women for? [Ed: CoinsBank, which also offered rooms for “18+ only” ladies, did not reply to multiple requests for comment.] The sea-swell swaying hallways are full of moody Eastern European teenagers in impractical heels. “We’re here as…as help,” one of them tells me in the elevator. She doesn’t look up from her phone. That evening, one guest tells me that male attendees are having room numbers discreetly sent to them on Telegram—the social network of choice, I learn, for pump-and-dump crypto schemers.*

The lion's share of everything that is wrong with crypto is that people keep allowing exchanges to circumvent consensus and decide which is/isn't the "valid chain"
While I think the entire "war" is stupid, by design of both sides there isn't a "right" chain yet and likely will not be for a long time to come
