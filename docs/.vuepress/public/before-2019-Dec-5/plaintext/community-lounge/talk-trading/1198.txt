seems more likely as everybody knows all alts are dead

[05-Nov-19 11:24 PM] Neko#5830
yep

[05-Nov-19 11:25 PM] Neko#5830
nSPV is really something elese

[05-Nov-19 11:25 PM] Neko#5830
seems like something satoshi himself was trying to do

[05-Nov-19 11:26 PM] Neko#5830
thats real scaling

[05-Nov-19 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
he wrote a lot about SPV, but for equihash coins just doing headers sync is not practical

[05-Nov-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
10x faster blocktimes and 20x bigger headers, makes for 200x more bandwidth/storage for SPV on KMD vs BTC

[05-Nov-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so nSPV was born

[05-Nov-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
dont even need the headers at all, well just the 10 blocks in the notarized segment, or 20kb

[05-Nov-19 11:29 PM] Neko#5830
he didn't imagined notary nodes

[05-Nov-19 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
true, BTC has no need for them

[05-Nov-19 11:31 PM] Neko#5830
@jl777c I'm just a noob with these technical terms but I know a big coin when I see one

[05-Nov-19 11:50 PM] Neko#5830

[06-Nov-19 01:23 AM] richardt#2807
Hoping mostly just hodlers left in KMD

[06-Nov-19 01:23 AM] richardt#2807
Otherwise, this will be shortlived

[06-Nov-19 02:42 AM] tolken#2655
wait, isn’t it the lack of non-holdlers that got  us here? 😃

[06-Nov-19 02:43 AM] tolken#2655
Wake me up when we’re at least 100% up from here.

[06-Nov-19 02:44 AM] tolken#2655
It would only be short lived only because fundamentally nothing has changed. KMD still remains one of the most compelling blockchain projects out there.  It’s just going through the motions. it’s time will come.

[06-Nov-19 03:51 AM] jspook16#3059
Possibilities are endless. I think kmd chips pangea etc can capture a big chunk of online gambling

[06-Nov-19 03:51 AM] jspook16#3059

[06-Nov-19 04:14 AM] Don King#8901
Looks like Sasha has finally decided to NOT honour the Coinomat asset swaps from the NXT era, his minion reports they are now done, 'on a case by case basis',  but looks like nobody got anything.

Sasha is one of the most dishonest crypto founders, fraud of his earliest investors, dragged out for nearly 4 years, done in broad daylight, shame on him!

WavesDex becomes Waves Exchange.
If I understand it correctly, more centralized components will be added.

You so know Sasha is going to try to sell off a Waves Exchange token. Lower trading fees if you hold the token. The Waves coin will just be a trading pair for all other coins.

binance blocked komodo funds deposit and withdrawal

[06-Nov-19 06:50 AM] Flint#6435
this is the manipulation of the market - to force to take profits at the current price and force to sell KMD since it is impossible to withdraw! The bloody exchanges didn’t even bother to notify coin holders that their funds would be blocked for any reason and you just go into your account and see that you cannot withdraw or deposit funds - they will push people into the arms of DEX

[06-Nov-19 07:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
There is a KMD update coming out. So its reasonable

[06-Nov-19 07:12 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I looked up komodo in the main crypto groups on fb and saw it mentioned like 3 times since 2017 😦 hopefully we as a community can grow komodo in 2020 😁

[06-Nov-19 07:22 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Are there any social media bounties currently?

[06-Nov-19 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
There was a form with all the bounties

[06-Nov-19 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But mostly if a strong community makes a big push, everyone wins

[06-Nov-19 07:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Agreed, I mean it’s not needed. But it would be good and might bring the right talent into Komodo too 😁

[06-Nov-19 08:19 AM] Oszy#5734
there was a twitter post, or an announcement here encouraging people to share the love on social media for rewards

[06-Nov-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah there was a form with a list of bounties, if you look in #official📢 you could probably find it

[06-Nov-19 09:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362

@Cryptoon yes the were. Satinders mined coins went to airdrop to everyone thst participated to give ARRR address for drop.

[06-Nov-19 10:01 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah you had to give your zaddr?

[06-Nov-19 10:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
An airdrop technically is done to all addresses, but as you dont know if a zaddr exists its hard to do an airdrop 😃

[06-Nov-19 10:05 AM] jorian#4555
at the time, we were giving out quite some ARRR, dollar wise

[06-Nov-19 11:12 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Chinese exchange? 🤔

[06-Nov-19 11:13 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Will volume from china start pouring in kmd?

[06-Nov-19 11:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Taking into account chinese stats has us in the top 20 rank i can see its plausible

[06-Nov-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Need USDT pair i think

[06-Nov-19 11:14 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Is USDT pair a big thing in china?

[06-Nov-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Our old mate CZ could help

[06-Nov-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes, that is most of the trading volume there

[06-Nov-19 11:15 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Can someone text CZ and let him know we need USDT pair

[06-Nov-19 11:16 AM] Markus#5464
I think that guy on twitter is over hyping things, he is writing that those coins will slightly outperform bitcoin 2020 and then u read this

I can remember the days where i thought bloody hell this has been trading sideways at 30k for a few weeks now......not at 8k lol

[06-Nov-19 11:17 AM] Markus#5464
meh we were at 30k during bear market mini alt season early 2019

[06-Nov-19 11:18 AM] Markus#5464
but sure if kmd will reach 30k and btc 20k, thats also good 😄

[06-Nov-19 11:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would rather 100k sats at 10k 🙂

[06-Nov-19 11:19 AM] Markus#5464
