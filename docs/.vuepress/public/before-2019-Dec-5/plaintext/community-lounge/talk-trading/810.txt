Jl u think that we gonna see new ATH's with the "better" alts? or is 2017 gone for alts and never coming back

[22-Jun-19 06:43 AM] CoinKing88#1540
i mean like Nano, KMD, Strat, etc coins with at least something to show for it

[22-Jun-19 06:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc 59,2% dominance

[22-Jun-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
never evaluate alts performance during BTC bull rampage

[22-Jun-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
everything is compressed, like a spring

[22-Jun-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as BTC is increasing dominance, by DEFINITION, all alt prices in BTC are going down. think about that

[22-Jun-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if dominance is going up, then altprices MUST go down

[22-Jun-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
@CoinKing88 when BTC dominance is back down to 40%, then the good alts will be higher.

[22-Jun-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the crypto cycle

[22-Jun-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it takes many cycles to separate the good alts from the bad

[22-Jun-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
and over time, any coin in the top 100 will become worth billions and billions of marketcap as the global financial system is decided to allocate at least some small percentage

[22-Jun-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the higher BTC goes, the more expensive it will feel, as it is indeed expensive and the more like bargains the alts are

[22-Jun-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
this BTC dominance is part of the cycle, it pulls in fiat funds into crypto, then dominance goes down and it flows into alts, dominance goes up, breathes in fiat, down and into alts

[22-Jun-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the bull market will be very crazy this time around. those who only experienced bear market will be in for some very surprising days

[22-Jun-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if half a trillion flows into BTC at the peak of its dominance, and the dominance drops by one third... that is 150 billion+ that will flow into the top 100

[22-Jun-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so during BTC rampage, turn off the charts, dont look at alt prices, it will just make you sad

[22-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
WAVES 2200 sats, 1.7x KMD, used to be 5x
STRAT 8550 sats,  0.65x KMD, used to be 10x+

[22-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the list goes on an on. KMD has done quite well against the other coins

[22-Jun-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
of course out of 10000 alts, you can always find some that are doing crazy big gains

[22-Jun-19 06:52 AM] Alecandro#1179
What’s KMD gonna hit this time around you guys think?

[22-Jun-19 06:52 AM] Alecandro#1179
$15 last time

[22-Jun-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be well above that

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will be after BTC has peaked

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yep def. that’s how it was before too

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so still a while to go, we are only 6 months from bear market low

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Alecandro#1179
Yea true that

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
so no reason to be in alts at the moment

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
and most of that time, was the "climb the wall of worry", so the bull market mode hadnt even started

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
most of my pf is btc anyway

[22-Jun-19 06:53 AM] Alecandro#1179
Man I hope we see another multi year bull market 💯

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i predict BTC wont be the #1 marketcap coin within 3 years

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
instead it will be the rise of the stablecoins

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] Alecandro#1179
Hm interesting

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] Alecandro#1179
I guess I could see that

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] Alecandro#1179
If there was a really successful one that was globally used

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but you will only get some percentages yield from such things

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
like debt vs equity markets

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] CoinKing88#1540
no money to be made on stablecoins for the gains?

[22-Jun-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
debt market much bigger

[22-Jun-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
stablecoins will need to match the same inflation rate as fiat, you know the one where 99% of value is lost over a century

[22-Jun-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
one reason BTC and other fixed supply crypto goes up is that the real inflation rate is actually quite a lot higher than the official figure

[22-Jun-19 06:57 AM] ph03nix#3115
infinite

[22-Jun-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
over long period of time, all fiats do seem to go the way of the bolivar

[22-Jun-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, to get on the BTC bull and trying to get back in at the right time is a very exciting game!

[22-Jun-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
you just need to time it so that BTC isnt going to go down after you buy, the alts keep going down, when you decide to get back into alts that it didnt already correct back to the mean. what can possibly go wrong?

[22-Jun-19 07:13 AM] LocoMB#8593
☕ 🌅 this is nice to wake up to! alts  getting dusted  by BTCs humongous dirt wake, but what the hell, will catch up eventually

[22-Jun-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, BTC is the motorboat pulling all the alts behind it, but there is a lot of slack in that rope

[22-Jun-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why i think of boats

[22-Jun-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
just hang on for the ride, i can 100% guarantee that BTC dominance will not go over 100%!

Lot of boat talk these days 😄

[22-Jun-19 07:19 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Looks like 10k is coming after all

[22-Jun-19 07:23 AM] LocoMB#8593
boat is a good metaphor 🚤 .. and alts are water skiers behind aspeedboat, can get rough at times.. :abusedsmily:

[22-Jun-19 07:23 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Just a bit sad were dropping on the mkap list

[22-Jun-19 07:24 AM] Bittersweet#9376
But not worried

[22-Jun-19 07:24 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Alts are under the water.... thats a dutch saying though

[22-Jun-19 07:28 AM] jspook16#3059
So it's not a good time to trade into alts?

[22-Jun-19 07:28 AM] Duck Tape#9059
Most alts are not down at all. It's Komodo that's down. Wake up.

🤦 (2) 

[22-Jun-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there are exactly 3 alts up against BTC on binance

[22-Jun-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is around the middle

[22-Jun-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@Duck Tape look at the actual binance BTC prices

[22-Jun-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
first page is -16% or worse

[22-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Bittersweet#9376
@jspook16 not out of fiat, that boat has sailed, but out of btc

[22-Jun-19 07:33 AM] Sherdogz#6731
Kmd isnt the worst today. but if you look at the last few days its another story

[22-Jun-19 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a whopping 8BTC of sells to 17k

[22-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Then again kmd had a small surge earlier this month

[22-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
When others didn't

[22-Jun-19 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i have bought quite a lot more than that OTC

[22-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Sherdogz#6731
That's also true

[22-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Bittersweet#9376
And volume stays similar in btc

[22-Jun-19 07:36 AM] Duck Tape#9059
@jl777c  Komodo's price cannot be explained by just saying that all alts are down. It's one of the worst performing alts these last few days. But I will just bye the dip.

[22-Jun-19 07:37 AM] Bittersweet#9376
@Duck Tape we are at the same place in markatcap as 3 months ago

[22-Jun-19 07:37 AM] Bittersweet#9376
things looked better for kmd than most until btc gained strength

[22-Jun-19 07:38 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Kmd just got squished harder

[22-Jun-19 07:38 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Shoild bounce back, still same people looking at it

[22-Jun-19 07:39 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Once you go kmd, you neevr go back 🍆

[22-Jun-19 07:39 AM] Duck Tape#9059
@Bittersweet I'm just disappointed. Seeing BTC going up and KMD going down, more than most alts. But I think in the long run kmd will do very well.

[22-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Yes I feel the same way about us not holding on to that early comeback

[22-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Bittersweet#9376
It's crypto

[22-Jun-19 07:41 AM] Duck Tape#9059
Crypto, worst thing that happened to me. But there is no turning back.

[22-Jun-19 07:43 AM] Bittersweet#9376
Woops, did you join in november-december 2017??

[22-Jun-19 07:46 AM] Sherdogz#6731
@Duck Tape you should always own btc as leverage and  in general then you should be good.

[22-Jun-19 07:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Remember this when the next bull market starts.....have some BTC

[22-Jun-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can pick the highest BTC dominance point in the cycle, that is when to shift into alts

[22-Jun-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
at the lowest BTC dominance, switch back to BTC

[22-Jun-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but impossible to know exact max/min dominance, so average in/out as it approaches high/low levels

60% dominance has been the recent resistance levels. BTC Dominance:  59.1%, 0.9% away from the resistance

[22-Jun-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if it breaks through the resistance, it could get up to 72%
