The 'doubts' are because a guy and his accomplices pulled strings to sabotage and spread fud. I didn't dream the  GS office ---- @KomodoWorld

@mrtzmp3 Are you carrying on a conversation with @KomodoWorld ? I assume he is hidden. Your posts look strange.

[15-Sep-19 11:48 PM] mrtzmp3#2896
I want him to read when he wake up not more

[15-Sep-19 11:49 PM] mrtzmp3#2896

Komodoworld has been around awhile,  I don’t think he is complicit  maybe just misled or scammed as well.   Benefit of the doubt

@mrtzmp3 as an "ecosystem deloper" I don't have time to have one-sided conversations with the air 🤷🏽

[16-Sep-19 01:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you wanted to have a conversation with just him then there's a mechanism for that which doesn't require you jizzing all over everyone else's screen

[16-Sep-19 01:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or.... If you just want to stir up more useless shit, then you were operating on the right path

[16-Sep-19 01:40 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Sry I must have mistaken this channel for the personal diary channel , where every discussion about actually trading is getting jizzed upon immediately . Excussed me . All I was initially asking was what happened to make Emmanuel leave here . It wasn't even about k64 in the first pls. So pls excuse me miss. I might have went over the top

[16-Sep-19 04:15 AM] Privatoshi#7913
I'd say I'm anti regulation.
But now, I think I'd prefer more financial transparency. I've yet to meet a dev, that doesn't do well financially. Whereas 9.5/10 traders break even, or don't profit. And if the response is to trade better, I'd counter and challenge a project to come up with a better system. Better than make ICO money, use ICO money for exchanges, 
where users can buy the coin to speculate on and then maybe get a few % for staking...

[16-Sep-19 05:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
So you would prefer that projects give their money to centralized exchanges?

[16-Sep-19 05:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm sure many do, and are sure to kiss the ring of the cmc gods as well. But exchange's motivations are questionable at best. The situation with cmc is akin to all the world's stock traders only trusting stock quotes from yahoo finance.

[16-Sep-19 05:25 AM] actionslacks#4072
to me the whole space feels almost completely rotten and corrupt to it's core right now. The fact that btc maximalism is the new cool thing in crypto is like witnessing some macro-psychological stockholm syndrome in real time.

[16-Sep-19 06:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@mrtzmp3 dont think I ever said anything about how k64 looks. Fwiw

[16-Sep-19 06:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I still hope its all legit though, would be better for everyone

buy ARRR

[16-Sep-19 07:53 AM] Markus#5464
Problem with ARRR is nobody knows about it and price is cheap so same individuals buy up the supply and most of them are also early miners so supply is pretty centralized im sure

{Reactions}
🤔 

[16-Sep-19 07:54 AM] Markus#5464
Can even be hedge funds, not hard for those to buy up 20% of supply just like that just have to be patient to bait out sellers

[16-Sep-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if KMD still had optional zaddr support, it too, would be delisted

[16-Sep-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
with ARRR, once atomicDEX supports zaddr swaps, it will become quite useful, pretty immediately

@Markus >> one delist matters when it also gets added to 3 new exchanges

[16-Sep-19 08:18 AM] Tek#5253
>> muh bash on dash

[16-Sep-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
all depends on the exchanges being added and subtracted

[16-Sep-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the largest exchanges that are following the regulatory path, these will likely delist privacy coins.

[16-Sep-19 08:20 AM] Tek#5253
dash has a legal entity in australia

[16-Sep-19 08:20 AM] Tek#5253
they will lobby themselves back on every platform

[16-Sep-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so?

[16-Sep-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810

It seem to be just like we all thought. Exchanges start delisting privacy coins left and right. The establishment don't like what they can't trace or control. Only just few days ago Upbit announced privacy coin delistings too.
