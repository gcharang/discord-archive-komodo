Did they release their gaming sdk yet

[19-Sep-19 06:20 AM] Oszy#5734
😄 what do you think?

[19-Sep-19 06:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or are they still changing just enough of the one they forked from kmd to claim they made it? 🙈🙈🙈

[19-Sep-19 06:21 AM] Oszy#5734
I bet Antara has more gaming code than them 😄

[19-Sep-19 06:31 AM] LocoMB#8593
yes, the whafting of hollow and stale phrases over there is indeed cringeworthy ...
sounds like random samplings from a psychotherapy self-help textbook for dummies, as @Oszy said

[19-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Even when tp is no longer ceo he keeps on spilling garbage which is just cringe

[19-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Other teammembers or whoever are much more on the down low

[19-Sep-19 07:38 AM] Markus#5464
Not sure why discussion about k64 keep going over and over, like JL said as long as there is no public announcements with proofs its useless to discuss them being legit or not

[19-Sep-19 07:40 AM] Markus#5464
It just turn into a shitshow discussing something like this, it does not lead anywhere at all

[19-Sep-19 12:01 PM] Caglio#3337

i missed you all ( :

[19-Sep-19 12:53 PM] allbits#5898
@Tek Agreed! Although I think BCH could become a decent base pair (or KMD)

[19-Sep-19 01:27 PM] Tek#5253
I'm fine with either

[19-Sep-19 01:31 PM] allbits#5898
BCH fiat onramps and offramps are excellent

[19-Sep-19 02:09 PM] Lennart#9331
i always thought DGB would be a nice base pair, confirms in 15 sec onchain and very low fees

[19-Sep-19 02:11 PM] Lennart#9331
large and active community too, i hope they will be very active in the atomicDEX

They knew Ethereum wouldn't scale, yet marketed it as scalable for years. Completely unethical and dishonest.

selling k64 1 cent each

[19-Sep-19 04:11 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@Neko it’d be great news for Komodo if there was a push for more of a public presence.  We are a small group shouting “wow Komodo is great” against their believers.  As of now we’re barely mentioned and have more skeptics against us than the supporters who stand with us.  In short, we need marketing but apparently that isn’t on the table until after the beta 😭

[19-Sep-19 04:23 PM] PTYX#6840
@grumpygoron there's more skeptics against us than supporters? that's a subjective assumption

[19-Sep-19 04:24 PM] PTYX#6840
there's more projects that back Komodo's efforts

[19-Sep-19 04:26 PM] Neko#5830
pump it and they will come

[19-Sep-19 04:27 PM] PTYX#6840
it's not all about marketing. it's about creating value and that's exactly what the team is doing.

[19-Sep-19 04:29 PM] grumpygoron#4320
True, but I’m not talking about projects, I’m talking about investors.  The people who have sold to help reach this point of an ATL sat price despite all the developments.  We are nearly bottom of the barrel with price and not even in top 50.  And yes, at THIS POINT where we are in the beta with the live version on the horizon it is about marketing.  We’ve got enough “created value” but not enough eyes on it.  What developments are in the pipeline that are going to create value exponentially enough from where we are now?  From following for the past few years it seems like we’re at the point where value is created but we need the proper mass adoption

[19-Sep-19 04:30 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Unless I’m missing some huge developments in the works and am wrong in thinking that we’re closer to a finished product than I thought.

[19-Sep-19 04:32 PM] grumpygoron#4320
So if there is a lot more development in the works and what is publicly available is only 20% of the finished product, then I’ll agree we need to create more value.  But if we’re over 50% in progress to a finished product, we need marketing to bring eyes to Komodo

[19-Sep-19 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
what do you suggest in regards to marketing?

[19-Sep-19 04:33 PM] PTYX#6840
it's not like you press a marketing button and all of the sudden you're popular.

[19-Sep-19 04:34 PM] PTYX#6840
In regards to a development that is exponentially adding value i'd point you to the atomicdex. The app alone will bring more revenue to Komodo than any other product it has launched before. It will also garner the support of dozens of communities and leverage their marketing power as well.

[19-Sep-19 04:39 PM] grumpygoron#4320
It’s not an easy button but a process, I agree.  And Atomicdex is phenomenal but to your point it’s not like we’ll launch it and all of a sudden there will be more revenue.  You can’t market without a product and you can’t have adoption to a product without marketing.  I think I’d just like to see more of a balance between the two but it was recently mentioned there won’t be a push until after beta.  Seems like a good time to push for more buzz.  I don’t know what happens behind the scenes but I thought there were people hired for specifically marketing reasons, my bad if I’m wrong and that’d make much more sense

[19-Sep-19 04:43 PM] meatspoon#7860
In terms of marketing, one of the things i have noticed is that the Komodo webpage desperately needs to show some examples of real world (possible) implementation of KMD and how it would benefit different businesses/industries.  Its mostly buzz words and esoteric nerdery.  Lots of projects have this problem.

[19-Sep-19 04:43 PM] grumpygoron#4320
I mean even JL said today “it seems the marketing of it can be happening in parallel along with the other related projects” over in talk-marketing. I understand we can’t have deadlines for something brand new, I’m just saying I’d like to see more of a balance with marketing to get more eyes coming in.  Some “easy to digest” content for the masses

[19-Sep-19 04:44 PM] grumpygoron#4320
@meatspoon my point exactly.  The tech is complex but the way we describe it is not “mass adoption friendly”.

[19-Sep-19 04:44 PM] meatspoon#7860
the KMD website needs a good 4 or 5 examples that would impact normal people of how KMD can be useful.

A new de-anonymization/linkability attack has come to light for all $ZEC and $XMR coins, being developed by $HUSH community members.
We are building a competitor to @chainalysis for Zcash + Monero forks.
We are self-funded but looking for investors to speed time-to-market....

Subpages can contain the technical stuff, but a homepage is for everyone to get a simple elevator pitch

[19-Sep-19 04:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
There is an ETH powered marketplace for home electricity in Europe... I forget what its called.  But home owners can place buy bids or accept sell bids directly from power companies, cutting out the middle man aggregator and reducing costs.   Its easy to get.

[19-Sep-19 04:46 PM] meatspoon#7860
Basic Attention Token is easy to get and its easy to get why ETH facilitates it.

[19-Sep-19 04:47 PM] meatspoon#7860
even Storj or Golem or other decentralized computing/storage daps are easy to get.

[19-Sep-19 04:48 PM] meatspoon#7860
But KMD reference material.... its like the writers/editors got paid by the buzz word.  "Oh, you used the words trustless, notarized, decentralized, immutable and fungible in a paragraph?  Here is your paycheck!" without any regard for the fact that only a sliver of people reading that will have the knowledge and open mindedness to understand the implications.

[19-Sep-19 04:50 PM] meatspoon#7860
You show real world use cases that Joe Sixpack can understand.  You (respectfully) point out the flaws of top smart contract platforms like ETH's gas and scaling issues.  And thats how the main page ought to look.  Let the techy guys dig deeper into the sub pages for all the tech shit that makes their little peckers hard.

its gonna involve pussy, i bet

[19-Sep-19 04:52 PM] Caglio#3337
We can try a different approach, its called lies, deceives and broken promises

[19-Sep-19 04:52 PM] Caglio#3337
As we learned from K64 team

[19-Sep-19 04:52 PM] meatspoon#7860
pussy dovetails well with lies, deception and broken promises.  often hard to separate the two.

whys that

[19-Sep-19 06:00 PM] Bitfinger#6245
Big fat bear div on daily and my bot is printing sell signals vs  btc, will have to wait for daily to close to see if it prints vs usd which is more reliable.

[19-Sep-19 06:06 PM] Markus#5464
last times kmd against btc is disqusting

[19-Sep-19 06:06 PM] Markus#5464
