I only wish I was smart enough to comprehend the extent that kmd tech reaches into the very existence of personal financial freedom to be able to articulate to the general pop.

@house i try to explain in simple words

[14-Sep-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
"Chapter 10 - channels example
It might be hard to believe, but channels CC implements an instant payment mechanism that is secured by dPoW in a way that is backward compatible with the existing wallets, explorers, etc. and channels CC does not require both nodes to be online. Its usecases are all the usecases for Lightning Network, it is just more secure, less expensive and backward compatible! The one aspect which some might consider a downside (and others another benefit) is that all payments are onchain. This means it would increase blockchain size, but the idea is for channels CC to be used on blockchains with relatively lower value coins, so a txfee of 0.0001 is not anything significant."

Hehe, love the dry humour. This is quite the improvement over lightning having to be both nodes live ... suggest trump it (apologies the term) when promo begins to leverage off the exposure ... will help to show how advanced you/we are

[14-Sep-18 11:07 AM] house#8741
Ps. You explain most eloquently. The challenge is for us to dumb it down to practical application

[14-Sep-18 11:12 AM] BlockTech#6895
I don't undestand guys, how can the price of a KMD be that low, when we see all the progress and all the tech komodo plateform has. Shouldn't we be at 50$ ? 😄

[14-Sep-18 11:23 AM] house#8741
suggest is partly historic/unsavoury experiences ... I for one will admit (with honesty) that I was bewildered by the different tech James was creating ... not realising that it was all part of a bigger picture.  That is the ‘ faux pas’ of the developer mindset I guess ... speaking of great achievements within the architecture that does not translate well to the trader mindset @BlockTech 
We have a duty I feel, to elaborate in simpler terms for the benefit of those not so techy

[14-Sep-18 11:27 AM] LocoMB#8593
@BlockTech we will be- just takes time. same as with Bitcoin way back then .. immature market, see, Dogecoin and trash like EOS.
at least, the era of outright shitcoins is mostly over .. no more CRAVE and A$$ and such

[14-Sep-18 11:30 AM] LocoMB#8593
saw good commentary recently somewhere- this is transition from speculation phase to productin phase- ie realize application and adoption, and this is not easy- many overhyped rainbow farts will evaporate, and that will be good!

[14-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
@BlockTech shouldn’t we be $50 ahead?

Don’t worry, I got it
