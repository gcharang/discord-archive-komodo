I'm honestly in love with vbk. Their horribly inefficient copy of Komodo is spamming the chain and it seems alot of the money pouring in is avoiding BTC for BCH. Hell transactions fees are median 1.37 right now that is outrageous. How do I buy dollar coffee when the fee is 1.37 :troll: .https://bitcoinfees.info/

[03-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
It would be interesting to see if the vbk team made any bch investments beforehand

[03-Apr-19 07:40 PM] Markus#5464
maybe the IEO money went into BCH

#Bitcoin surged overnight -- and according to @andrewrsorkin it might have something to do with an April Fool's joke.... https://t.co/5ZxJVrFJht

It was an April fools joke. Now it makes sense 🙃

[03-Apr-19 07:55 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why is everyone so surprise with this surge?

[03-Apr-19 07:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hasnt anyone expeirence a 20% rise in one day for btc? It used to be pretty common some years ago

[03-Apr-19 07:57 PM] PTYX#6840
It's just people trying to make news

[03-Apr-19 07:59 PM] PTYX#6840
There seems to be that many if not most people are in bitcoin for the price action. So it does make sense that they would celebrate around normal movements.

[03-Apr-19 08:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Desired target achieved... now i think we may have so sideways for some time

[03-Apr-19 08:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Maybe we get to $6k first then sideway

[03-Apr-19 08:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but we surely need to make support at this area first before continuing

[03-Apr-19 08:03 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the $6k resistance wont be easy to break... MANY people bought that area thinking it was the bottom back in october

[03-Apr-19 08:15 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Its obviously heading for 6k

[03-Apr-19 08:24 PM] Alexfrog#1338
if only KMD wouldnt drop every time it goes up

[03-Apr-19 08:25 PM] p.#1126

the report should be somewhere around the internets

FOMO is real though, i think we will se a local top soon

[03-Apr-19 08:44 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
then see a move in alts, then boring for some time, then break $6k then move to the moon and live there

[03-Apr-19 09:05 PM] REX#3983
kmd either holds its sat value here or drops to 22k. if it does it will have a hard time getting past 25k.

on the other side of the coin however...we can easily bounce here to 28k, 32kand 35k as reasonable targets

*Main competitors in the segment of 51% attack protection as-a-service are:
Komodo DPoW, which is a centralized solution, qualitatively very similar to PoP.*

[03-Apr-19 09:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@benohanlon perhaps

[03-Apr-19 09:14 PM] Cryptoon#3362
* At current rates, the average price of one VBK is therefore around 4000 satoshi for these miners to break even. Based on individual users’ efficiency, this can be higher or lower. The above calculation forgoes failed PoP transactions, which do not net any reward. Based on discussions
As shown in the graph below, the costs of VeriBlock Proof of Proof have been steadily growing since High Noon testnet launch.*

Crazy mining returns at a ieo price of 12k tbh

[03-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Vertigo#0439
Litecoin $91....

[03-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or wait was it 1.2k sats

[03-Apr-19 09:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
*In Komodo, which is a system very similar to Delegated Proof of Stake, the Notary nodes automatically put their OP_RETURN proofs into the Bitcoin blockchain just by the virtue of existing. These nodes get their rewards by securing the DPoS system. New coins can join DPoW only by requesting the developers, who then add the coin to the protection umbrella. Interestingly, the Notary nodes (users) have no say in this.*

Argh No one on dp will sell kmd near market

[03-Apr-19 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`No one on dp will sell kmd near market`
Maybe because the market is closed and offline?

At least KMD is 1000% up from ico

[03-Apr-19 09:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
I would guess that depends on a number of things. You don't really strike me as a hot chick though @Caglio  so I'll have to pass.

We charge for the notarization service in a very specific service that is proven to work.

[03-Apr-19 10:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They charge you to mine their shitcoin without any type of obligation with the miner

[03-Apr-19 10:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I mean, that is quite scammy.

[03-Apr-19 10:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
They charge you BTC to mine a shitcoin, how absurd can that be?

[03-Apr-19 10:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
In any case they should be giving btc to people that mine their shitcoin, not the other way around

[03-Apr-19 10:24 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The point of notarizations is not to just notarize for the sake of it... in that case the notary network would not be needed

[03-Apr-19 10:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The point of the notarizations is to be able to use them in benefit of other coins, to make users safe by letting the coin clients know which way to look if something is wrong

[03-Apr-19 10:29 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If there are no hard coded pubkeys jn the code, what stops someone from making a farm that is significant enough to notarjze the wrong forks?

[03-Apr-19 10:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or just renting to do that

[03-Apr-19 10:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is even worse than a vanilla 51% attack

[03-Apr-19 10:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If there are no hard coded pubkeys. There is actually a chain reaction that is impossible to control

[03-Apr-19 10:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m not worried about them, simple math shows that not only are they inefficient notarizing , they are inefficient with the notaries and their pay a percentage of your coin to be notarized is more expensive than DPoW .

[03-Apr-19 10:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Customer, system and service provider all getting screwed . No one will use it

[03-Apr-19 10:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Open source only stops that bit of FUD.  Still doesn’t justify the economic model

[03-Apr-19 10:35 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its not fud, the only fud is the one they are throwing at us, attacking us of being "centralized"

[03-Apr-19 10:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It only shows how focused they are in the market dimension of it
