[slack] <tolken> Thanks @Bowdo I think it was a metamask glitch. Was using 15gwei and still taking hours.

[17-Jun-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Bittersweet> Are we on discord or on matrix now

[17-Jun-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <locomb> time to ditch slack entriely and move on to discord? most other big boys are there already, WAVES, IOTA, ... slack does have its drawbacks

[17-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Bittersweet> @locomb wanna shoot the discord link?

[17-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <mark0759> What is the invite link

anybody that thinks dPoW notaries are the same as dPoS block producers should read: https://steemit.com/eos/@eosargentina/eos-mainnet-status-update

dPoW notaries have no monopoly on creating blocks, this is a very very big difference in powers

Hilarious flop.

Komodo will be seen, sooner or later, as the real deal. 👍 Investors and users will look after proven stable projects.

[slack] <koray.gurur> What are the devs mainly favoring: discord or slack?

[17-Jun-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> discrod will get to matrix where the devs are

[17-Jun-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <PTYX> all internal comms were moved to matrix

[17-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <koray.gurur> Nice one, thanks for the quick reply

[17-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> So slack is abandoned for the most part?

[17-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> From an official standpoint

[17-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[17-Jun-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <ButtcoinSub4k> miss ? kmd is a sub .. no one knows about it until we submerge

[17-Jun-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <tolken> Not sure what the reason for the shift is/was. My main issue with slack is the lack of history.  Seems very expensive if you want to upgrade to get history too. Cant upload images. Maybe that’s why they’re transitioning.

[17-Jun-18 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Bittersweet> @hollowman9000 it nobody would have invited me, I would still be only here...

Who needs bleeding edge technology when you can have a Litecoin fork! Right?

what's the falling wedge pattern on KMD looking like for the next week or two @siu - Chainmakers - i read in another discord there's two they are watching, one ends soon and another one extends to 22k

[18-Jun-18 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So is there a way to do sportsbetting with crypto/kmd?

[18-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
With the world cup I find matches more interesting with some skin in the game

[18-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But unibet requires me to send my id and social security number to check with the govt etc

[18-Jun-18 06:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So yeah, not going to tell the govt what a degenerate I am

[18-Jun-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
they already know. but supporting people's degeneracy will likely be after CC is mainnet

[18-Jun-18 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Cant wait

[18-Jun-18 07:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And also bummer

[18-Jun-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> damn this market

[18-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm seeing PRLPAY/KMD swaps on dexstats.info

[18-Jun-18 10:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is this for testing or is the dICO live?

[18-Jun-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <siu> Its for testing

[18-Jun-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> @rhex1 I lost interest in it

[18-Jun-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> It can crash all to hell for all I care

[18-Jun-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hollowman9000> Maybe that means something

[18-Jun-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> so you... capitulated?

[18-Jun-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> New ATH next week then:)

[18-Jun-18 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <cascrypto> good thing everyone left , than we can start complaining what a fuck price when moon damm this is depressing. back to work as a good slave yes I love my job boss 😭

[18-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> I've more or less capitulated. I was messing about and opening a small long at 7500 but at this point I'm content to see it liquidated if it comes to pass and ready to buckle down fully for accumulation

[18-Jun-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <1stormingj> 2018 is probably going to continue to be a boring one, with any luck I'll be given plenty of changes to cost average new buys at reasonably low prices

[18-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Capitulated in the sense of giving up and selling

[18-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or in the sense of just saying fuck it not looking at the price anymore for xxx days

[18-Jun-18 12:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
"I've got all the time in the world"

[18-Jun-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <rhex1> I think a lot of people are actually selling. Personally, I'v just stopped looking.

$KMD / $BTC :
Critical support being tested. 
If it fails, it's very likely we'll see 25k.

@Hollowman9000 how is ETH (which is down 40%) any different?

[slack] <tolken> I hope to see an ethLend like dAPP built on kmd.  One advantage I see in the KMD ecosystem would be BarterDex integration. Imagine someone used KMD smart contract to hold 100eth as collateral to borrow 5btc. Smart contract hits an agreed upon liquidatin threshold and starts auto liquidating via BarterDex :)

[18-Jun-18 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <tolken> Could be an amazing use case
