[28-Aug-18 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
hold your breath for anything iota until a major company ships a product with using it to the production market.

[28-Aug-18 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Am I supposed to heed advice from someone who doesn’t know the difference between “loose” and “lose”?

If you’re in a position at breakeven or profit and you’re feeling “hopeful” why not close it? Trade, don’t gamble. Analyse and make money. Don’t guess and loose. NEVER LOOSE MONEY!!! 😊
