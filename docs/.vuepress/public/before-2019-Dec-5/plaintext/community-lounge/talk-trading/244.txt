If SHA256 is comprimised in some way all of crypto is dead... very scary situation

[23-Oct-18 11:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I could break BTC tomorrow :trollface:

`everyone trying out lighting having a bad experience?`
"good" and "bad" are relative terms
Anyone that accepts that LN is **not** part of bitcoin will likely have a "good" experience
Anyone that thinks that LN **is** part of bitcoin will likely become disillusioned once they realize that most uses for it are non-personal

If I had the kind of bank that let me use $2M just to manipulate 1 market, I'm fairly certain I'd spend less time staring at 3 monitors for 18 hrs a day 😛

`"Why not improve BCH"? That doesn't make any sense.`
Sure it does, BCH is rekt because core didn't write it

[23-Oct-18 11:44 AM] snowdamn#2414
would still be in front of the 3 screens most likely

[23-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jorian#4555

in case the point was missed: it doesn't matter which camp you are in, i am just pointing out that it's ridiculous to make statements like "bch devs are smarter" which can't be really proven anyway, may the better coin win, it doesn't matter for trading, you just go with the market. in general competition is good, but companies/institutions/teams that are obsessed on destroying their competition rather than improving their own stuff are usually wiped out of markets.

[23-Oct-18 12:13 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you could search rplace the source code to gecko 😉

[23-Oct-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`you could search rplace the source code to gecko `
I could do that and make it a 'genie', too 😛

I had some coin last year that a mate showed me MAGA coin where they forked LTC and made the  source code say build a wall of bricks instead of a chain of blocks... genious, must have taken them a while 😂

[23-Oct-18 12:47 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
for the whale it would also make sense to stop accumulating, wait a week, let price go down again, restart at 15-18k sats

[23-Oct-18 12:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless he wants to sell the last 6M at 40k sats

[23-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Tek#5253

[23-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Tek#5253
> buy a million kmd to pump the price to dump 6 million at 40k 🤔

nothing we haven't seen before rite

letz go boyos.

[23-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think he stays below the 21k range for a reason

[23-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If we break above then we would breakout pattern upward

[23-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And bots would pile in?

[23-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Vertigo#0439
I don't know how easy would be to dump 6 million kmds

[23-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
depends on the ceiling, if you move the market up high enough, 6M might only drop it back down to 20k
rinse... repeat

[23-Oct-18 02:51 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
only 6 btc total sell oders left on binance, highest I saw was ~15 btc I believe

[23-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And someone posted 5btc kmd sell

[23-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
And when someone marketbought 4k of them it was swiftly removed

[23-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Sellers are running thin

[23-Oct-18 03:54 PM] Cryptoon#3362
