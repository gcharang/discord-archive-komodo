Maybe you were on a fork before updating?

[16-Dec-18 07:45 PM] skyguynca#0562
but when I updated shouldn't my daemon be on the correct fork?

[16-Dec-18 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
what blockheight you are at?

[16-Dec-18 07:47 PM] skyguynca#0562
1142784

[16-Dec-18 07:47 PM] SHossain#0007
are you using sapling supported pool software?

[16-Dec-18 07:48 PM] skyguynca#0562
yep S-Nomp

[16-Dec-18 07:51 PM] SHossain#0007
how much hash your pool has?

[16-Dec-18 07:53 PM] skyguynca#0562
300k, I used to see a block every hour to 2 hours up to the 14th Dec, now not a single one since

[16-Dec-18 07:54 PM] SHossain#0007
try renting some hash to test. maybe 300k is low

[16-Dec-18 07:55 PM] SHossain#0007
or maybe an experienced pool operator can help you

[16-Dec-18 08:15 PM] skyguynca#0562
2018-12-16 12:14:06 [Pool]      [komodo] (Thread 2) getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-9,"message":"Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!"}
how can I tell if the cain is out of sync?

[16-Dec-18 08:16 PM] skyguynca#0562
ok, so the error I am getting as you can see @SHossain  it is plainly says the chain not in synce, there are peers connected

[16-Dec-18 08:17 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodo-cli getinfo`

[16-Dec-18 08:17 PM] skyguynca#0562
so that leaves chain not in sync, and my question was how can i check, I was  not asking about the pool

[16-Dec-18 08:18 PM] skyguynca#0562
after I updated with the sapling to the daemon, was I supposed to get new addresses like I had to with ARRR, or will the current addresses still be ok?

[16-Dec-18 08:19 PM] SHossain#0007
current R address should work

[16-Dec-18 08:19 PM] SHossain#0007
last time i asked you which block height you are at, you posted `1142784`. that means you should be in sync.

[16-Dec-18 08:21 PM] SHossain#0007
the message you are posting is not from komodo daemon, but the pool software itseld. you need to make sure you have set up your pool properly. if not, ask for help from other pool operators. they can help you./

[16-Dec-18 08:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if you can post the output of `./komodo-cli getinfo`, that could help understanding your wallet issues

Bitcoin miners shutting down world wide! Bitmain in trouble.
Bitcoin miners shutting down world wide! Bitmain in trouble. And it looks like the problem is getting worse for all the big miners across the world. Makes me...

If they still have more income than their marginal cost

[17-Dec-18 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They should keep mining

[17-Dec-18 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And just cut back on overhead to stay profitable

[17-Dec-18 08:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So this guys reasoning isnt entirely 100%

@Cryptoon but big players must pay back all the people they owe, I think is the big factor. People borrowed money thinking BTC would go from 20K to 100K and now it's at 3K. They are in the deep red and can't afford to keep going in that direction. People who grew "smart" and didn't overextend, can follow your advice

[17-Dec-18 07:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Glad I didn't take any loans for my farm , really wanted to, guess it's a blessing in disguise

[17-Dec-18 07:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Was even better that I used kmd to fund it all,  already 75% ROI in 2 months

Nice nice... That's what decentralisation is all about

[18-Dec-18 02:01 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Aussie miners, I'd like to introduce https://minethechains.com/ 
This pool provides easy to switch KMD & Pirate mining(just change the port), with more KMD assetchains being added soon!
Please consider us if you'd like a low latency connection(compared to pools hosted in NA or EU). We offer a 1% fee and quick payouts (~3mins for ARRR & ~10mins for KMD).
The website is currently in construction, and if you join, have any feedback, or request a specific assetchain to be added, please let me know.

[18-Dec-18 04:38 AM] skyguynca#0562
Hey guys, I have had a private pool for about a month, it is doing good. I had some problems but I believe they are all worked out. It is just a basic S-NOMP pool, still the included pages from the download. I am looking for some  asic miners to come and try it out, give it a good testing. Today just concentrating on KMD and looking for some of you to jump on and load it with hashing power. 1% fee to  cover the server and you get everything else you earn. I provide all testers with my contact info including text number if you need to contact me while you are testing. Plus i will be monitoring my PM on the discord. Please come and help me test and let's make some coin,  I have not gotten a URL yet so still using ip address+port for main page. There you will get the coins and ports for mining. Please behave yourself I will ban all IP's immeadiately attempting to poke around where you don't belong. PM me for details,  Thanks David

[18-Dec-18 04:41 AM] skyguynca#0562
45.63.88.79:8080 Main Page, KMD is stratum+tcp://45.63.88.79:4123

[18-Dec-18 07:23 AM] skyguynca#0562
well that was a bust, thanks everyone for participating.....now on to the problem ok, so something is dreadfully wrong. on the 12, 13, 14th DEC I was averaging 25 blocks a day KMD, that is 25 x 2.97 = 74.25 KMD a day in block rewards. Have screen shot can show you. 15th did sapling upgrade and not a single block since. I figured I missed something or messed something up. So I completely wiped the server and reinstalled all the daemons. I let all of them sync, KMD - ZEC -ZCL all done but ZEN is still working on it...22 hours later. Anyway for the past 5 hours myself and a friend put all our asics on KMD, mined hard at 600k+ kh/s.....we should have blocked in under 3 hours, we let it go to 4 hours and 15 minutes ......no blocks at all, The diff was only 720k and we have over 900k in shares when we gave up. ......help me out please, something changed drastically with the sapling upgrade and my pool is not mining KMD now.

[18-Dec-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need a pool that works with sapling

[18-Dec-18 07:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the answer will be in debug.log when the pool tries to submit a block

[18-Dec-18 08:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You may have a pool configuration issue too, it could be loads of things. You've given us no technical information about your problem, I.e, pool outputs, debug.log outputs from the daemon. That info would be handy to help out

[18-Dec-18 01:17 PM] skyguynca#0562
no pool outputs out of the usual, nothing to show that it ever found a block and rejected it........just never found a block. Before I did the sapling update I was finding blocks np. in 9 hours usually 19-25 blocks, after the update nothing at all, I could mine with all 300kh/s for 24 hours and nothing. I am sure it is a setting or a problem with the daemon itself, if I had something to show then I would not have to ask what could be the problem.

[18-Dec-18 01:24 PM] bishop#9773
You updated your pool config to support how blocks are created in sapling, correct? Not just updating the daemon

[18-Dec-18 06:05 PM] skyguynca#0562
yep

[18-Dec-18 10:18 PM] skyguynca#0562
in my komodo getinfo it says " sapling": -1,  is that correct? my version is 0.3.1

[18-Dec-18 10:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@skyguynca no

[18-Dec-18 10:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
`  "sapling": 1140409,`

[18-Dec-18 10:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
means you are stuck on a block pre-sapling activation

[18-Dec-18 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
#deleted-channel just had a discussion on how to get a chain to sync that is stuck right around the sapling height

[18-Dec-18 11:34 PM] skyguynca#0562
where is that discussion?

[18-Dec-18 11:37 PM] skyguynca#0562
I searched back to 12/04, is it before that?

[18-Dec-18 11:46 PM] skyguynca#0562
ok found it, I have started and stopped, rescan and resync. then I wipped the server clean and did a full install

[19-Dec-18 05:11 AM] skyguynca#0562
OK, resync'd again, this time it made it.......  "version": 2001526,

HI guys, I wanted to ask as miner beginner what are your tips and tricks or some hacks :pirate: for better mining efficiency ?

[19-Dec-18 06:42 AM] bishop#9773
Cheap power and ASICs

[19-Dec-18 09:51 AM] gzezo#2697
What do you think about overcklocking I am having GPUs RIGs only now, for KMD I will need to order ASIC I know

I am looking for some enlargement pill to give my rigs couple percent boost 🤓

[19-Dec-18 10:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
MSI afterburner is a decent program for a GUI afterburner

[19-Dec-18 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`what are your tips and tricks or some hacks :pirate~1: for better mining efficiency ?`
1) don't use a GPU

[19-Dec-18 01:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
2) Overclocking is only a gain if you test rages (ironically, some modern GPUs are actually more efficient if you __under__clock them)

[19-Dec-18 01:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
3) If you live in the US (many other countries already use 200+) - run at 220v and not 110v (the power curve is less efficient on standard "110" [which is actually 115-120- but I digress])

[19-Dec-18 02:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
that a good point about the 220v.

[19-Dec-18 04:34 PM] gzezo#2697
Agree, we have 220v here by default. Overall I am trying to figure out what is the most efficient things to focus on, if on contacting power plant owners, some software,firmware hacks or what

[19-Dec-18 05:02 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
honestly, all of the above
If you're big enough to be contacting power co, then imo nothing should be running "stock" settings
But that's also kind of a "coin-flip" depending on *how big* (past a certain point customization man-hours are a wash to the write-off of any "losses" of not doing so)

[19-Dec-18 05:48 PM] skyguynca#0562
I have been looking at https://www.coinexchange.io/network/peers/KMD for my daemon to show up as a peer. It has been running for a couple of day and I don't see it.. Do I need to open the port in the confg file?

you might become a 2-way peer to a specific node in seconds or never

[19-Dec-18 06:00 PM] skyguynca#0562
Yesterday my daemon stuck at a block, I did the restart, then resync and it finished last night and it shows all is well and working. Yet I have been on my pool for 20 hours with 300k h/s and no blocks. I have not found a single block since the 14th of DEC....something has to be wrong since I did the sapling upgrade

[19-Dec-18 06:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
there's so many different reasons that could be, I wouldn't know where to start other than saying "check your logs"

[19-Dec-18 08:13 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
And configuration files. A simple missed capitalisation will hurt you. Speaking from experience

Hi, who knows. On pirate pool. asic farm, difficulty 700k-1,3kk, but my ASIC farm 5 days and paid - Zero. Difficulty Shared already near 2,8kk
Who knows why not paid ?

[19-Dec-18 08:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Dre "difficulty" has exactly nothing to do with payouts

[19-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Dre#1895
Yes, update, 15.12 last paid

[19-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Dre#1895
I understand it, but also. What i can do?  On this pool only me

[19-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Dre#1895
*can I do

[19-Dec-18 08:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you are the only miner on a given pool, then you will have larger payouts (per payout) and longer periods between payouts

[19-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Dre#1895
1-2 blocks 1day

[19-Dec-18 08:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If, for some reason, you "need" daily payouts, then you need to join a large pool

[19-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Dre#1895
Balance already 5 days is *freezee*, paid is not. May be pool not work? Or my asic not found block 5 days?

@webworker01 I switch to KNOMP, it blocked an hour after I started. Thank you. The guys at S-NOMP said that it was sapling ready, but none of them could tell me how to ativate it. I changed nothing but loaded your KNOMP and blocked right away. Again THANK YOU, THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

`The guys at S-NOMP said that it was sapling ready`
The key to that is that it's "sapling-ready" for ZEC and they care fekall about KMD

[19-Dec-18 10:39 PM] skyguynca#0562
hmmm, i was led to believe it worked with all my c oins, and it was a DEV who told me just to update the daemon and restart snomp and it will work

skyguynca12/03/2018
so when you have time and I have not worn out my welcome, I need help understanding what the sapling upgrade is? will the upgrade be easy to do on the 4 coins I run on my pool ZEC ZCL ZEN and KMD? Do you have to do it?
Potato12/03/2018
It will just require a daemon update when they release it and then restart the pool at the block height it activates

[19-Dec-18 10:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
