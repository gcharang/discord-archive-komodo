hmmm

I hadn't seen the ++ before

[25-Mar-19 03:53 PM] MyName#0491
you might have just linked yourself out of a sale 😛

[25-Mar-19 03:54 PM] MyName#0491
not a fan of May/June shipping though 😕

[25-Mar-19 03:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol price is comparable, considering tariffs ,shipping from China and  cryptominer tax

With PSU,  1775 if you pay with BTC, 2 month wait time and 350 on top for the customs crap ( unless you can still get around that ,  I know they have gotten wise ), 2100 . 3 full size , a little cheaper and there within  the week and no govt flagging .

[25-Mar-19 04:04 PM] MyName#0491
that moment when you realize that you have enough options that you need a spreadsheet to calculate what to do ...

[25-Mar-19 04:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also I’m looking for some Verus,  so could part with a couple for that currency if you have any lying around.

Same,  one of the few coins I missed out on in the ecosystem

[25-Mar-19 04:20 PM] Lumbi#8378
@MyName what's so terrible about snomp? v1 = mike classic 😃

[25-Mar-19 04:29 PM] MyName#0491
@Lumbi if it's mike's fork, nothing
if it's the "official" s-nomp, it's quite discouraging to see products from outside the ecosystem being used when there are better versions inside it

[25-Mar-19 04:37 PM] Lumbi#8378
@MyName decentralization has advocates and detractors.  what's with s-nomp?

[25-Mar-19 04:38 PM] MyName#0491
` what's with s-nomp?`
besides the countless hours, days, and weeks that webby and I have put into making pools, nothing

[25-Mar-19 04:39 PM] Lumbi#8378
@MyName equihash then?

[25-Mar-19 04:39 PM] MyName#0491
?

[25-Mar-19 04:40 PM] Lumbi#8378
@MyName equihash mining

[25-Mar-19 04:43 PM] MyName#0491
My point is that the fact that s-nomp "official" works for anything inside the Komodo ecosystem is coincidental; whereas, miketout's fork of it, webby's pools, and my pools are specifically written to ensure that they do

[25-Mar-19 04:43 PM] MyName#0491
be it for verushhash or equihash

[25-Mar-19 04:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Lumbi Basically if a problem arises, you will already know the answer to your question ( upgrade to kmd developed pool software )

[25-Mar-19 04:50 PM] MyName#0491
but to the extent of equihash, there's something to be said for the fact that s-nomp "official" uses ZCL as their readme example and they didn't even fix sapling for ZCL until the day after it was fully activated (weeks after it was added to ZCL)

🐔 ChickenPool has now been updated to a full 1% pool fee (including tx fees/rewards), instead of the prior flat fee of 0.03 🐔

HUSH Announcement for Pool Operators, 

As you may be aware, HUSH is upgrading from Sprout to Sapling. With that upgrade HUSH will be converting to a Komodo Asset Chain as well. We've noticed that your pool supports mining of KMD, HUSH, or other Komodo Asset Chains and felt that we should make you aware of this change. We would like for you to consider adding or updating HUSH. We are offering bounties for pools both pre-existing and new. There will be bounties of 1,000, 500, 300, 200, and 100 HUSH for the first 5 pools to process any kind of payment on the new HUSH asset chain. There will also be an additional 250 HUSH for the first 5 pools to process Sapling payouts.

Our snapshot is taking place at block 500,000, and we are estimated for a snapshot date of April 14th. Please join us on Discord if you haven't already at https://www.myhush.org/discord and message me (Berg) or post in the #mining channel and I will have you added to our private Pool Operator channel where you'll receive news and support from our developers. 

Thank you for your consideration/support of HUSH. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out through our Discord.

tmw you waste 2 hrs trying to figure out why your pool stops making payments and find out its:
```komodo-cli -ac_name=RFOX getbalance "*" 2

I think one of my mini's died today 😢 It doesn't want to do anything over 100M frequency

[30-Mar-19 12:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Has anyone seen this before?

[30-Mar-19 12:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've had mini boards drop out and recover on a reboot, but never die die

[30-Mar-19 04:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have one that I can't find the network with... or on my network.

[30-Mar-19 04:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Suggestions?

[30-Mar-19 04:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It runs, lights are all green and no aircraft engine sounds... but I can't find it on any of mthe pools I use.

open that on a win PC or vm, go to "Report IP", click "Start", and then push the "IP Report" button on the mini

[30-Mar-19 05:40 AM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka I have a mini that always ends up doing 0 sols. I have to keep restarting it until it works then it works until it doesn't

[30-Mar-19 05:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay. Ill keep trying to reboot it. Anything above 100M it just wont even register the chips and sits at nearly 100% fan speed.

[30-Mar-19 07:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Alright I have one unit like that.  I reduced the OC and it found a stable point.

[30-Mar-19 11:00 AM] rob#8269
Hi any kmd pool hash chart for reference. And the lots of pool listed under pinned msg doesn’t active anymore

[30-Mar-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
http://chickenpool.com works

[30-Mar-19 12:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@rob

[30-Mar-19 05:39 PM] rob#8269
But only few workers n 180kh.

[30-Mar-19 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, join and make more @rob 
1+1=2

? Whts tht?

❓ 

[30-Mar-19 05:42 PM] rob#8269
It will takes a few days to find a block

{Reactions}
🤦 

[30-Mar-19 05:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because you're in a hurry to spend your 0.037 KMD?

[30-Mar-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@rob if you can find a pool that earns 10 KMD in less time than it takes to earn 10 KMD, then please let me know and I'll send all my hash to that pool

[30-Mar-19 05:47 PM] rob#8269
Why 0.037??

[30-Mar-19 05:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
ballpark guess of what hash you have that wouldn't find a block in "days" 🤷🏽

[30-Mar-19 05:49 PM] rob#8269
So u re guessing my hash worth 0.037 kmd for few days mining. ?

[30-Mar-19 05:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you think that adding your hashrate to the pool would make block finds *slower*, then yes

[30-Mar-19 05:51 PM] rob#8269
My point is , 180kh will takes a while to find a block .

[30-Mar-19 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
current rate is 10-15 blocks per day, if you join and it takes days to find 1 then your hashrate is negative 
because, math

[30-Mar-19 05:53 PM] rob#8269
Then u re taking a wild guess. I don’t know how many blocks they managed to find per day. And may I know their pool location

[30-Mar-19 05:53 PM] rob#8269
And bcos of simple math , adding my hash of course is a plus.

[30-Mar-19 05:53 PM] rob#8269
Don’t need to be so sarcastic.

[30-Mar-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
not to mention that if that's just hyperbole on your part, you would actually get an increase in share % by joining, so it would be win/win

[30-Mar-19 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Don’t need to be so sarcastic.`
And yet you were 🤷🏽

[30-Mar-19 05:54 PM] rob#8269
Err Wht is hyperbole?

Tks.  Mr ego.

[30-Mar-19 05:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yw Mr I don't care about math I only want to follow the masses

[30-Mar-19 06:01 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@rob in summary, on average you should mine the same amount, regardless of the pool hash. A lower hash pool gets slower payments, but they're larger, whereas, a higher hash pool gets more frequent payouts, but are smaller.
There are plenty of KMD pools out there. You could have a look at https://minethechains.com if you'd like to join my pool

Veriblock is mineable by FPGAs now, I wonder what they think of that and what that does to their attack protection

[01-Apr-19 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I have gathered, no chain actuall uses the VBK protection, so all this BTC spam is just for fun

[01-Apr-19 10:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
but can I dump these coins on an exchange? They don't seem to be on CMC or advertise exchanges

[01-Apr-19 10:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
but this calculator is telling me some crazy numbers, that I don't trust at all, and trying to research

[01-Apr-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
just trust that the exchange price will be around the offering price

[01-Apr-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it will trade on bittrex next week

[01-Apr-19 10:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am lurking in their discord a bit

[01-Apr-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
lots of deep discussions about blockchain security?

[01-Apr-19 10:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
$10/day profit on a blackminer F1 for VBK right now, but I am not sure if only hosted miners have that bitstream

[01-Apr-19 10:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
they release bitstreams to hosted miners first

[01-Apr-19 10:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i am seeing some technical discussion of people having issues running their code, but I just joined and haven't seen much. Around 2500 people on their discord

[01-Apr-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it appears to be a bid for notarization setup, which means anybody with deep pockets can create a notarization? but totally unclear about altcoin changes needed, i heard from no changes required, to having to add some code

[01-Apr-19 10:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
FPGA spec mining seems very time sensitive. If I decided to mine VBK, I need to make sure I dump on Bittrex or all the other FPGA miners will dump the price to oblivion, I imagine. Race to the bottom

[01-Apr-19 10:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c maybe I will try to be a vbk notarizer or whatever they call them, and see what happens. In my copious fee time 😅

[01-Apr-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but if VBK price goes to zero, how can that subsidize the BTC txfee?

[01-Apr-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
somebody has to pay for all the BTC txfees, 100,000+ BTC tx/per day cant be cheap

[01-Apr-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so either the VBK miners, or the notarizer or the altcoin is subsidizing the BTC txfees

[01-Apr-19 10:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
People invested massively in submarine companies in the 1600's to find sunken treasure and no submarine was ever built until the 1800's

[01-Apr-19 10:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
belief is a strong thing

[01-Apr-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but dPoW has been in service almost 3 years

[01-Apr-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is 1803

[01-Apr-19 10:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
VBK is run by a bunch of dudes that look like they just walked out of their MBA class and has a physical office in South Florida, I place I am familiar with. Lots of wealthy people by the beach. My gut tells me they are biz savvy and tech is just a way to get to the profits

[01-Apr-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
what "tech"?

[01-Apr-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
trying to find out if there is any actual tech that makes sense. so far I see a BTC spam machine that is certainly decentralized as it uses speculative miners paying the BTC txfee in hopes of a big VBK price. also a lot of the mining is likely veriblock themselves

[01-Apr-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
you dont just go from zero to 100,000+ miners in a blink

[01-Apr-19 10:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
it sure does look like "tech" from the viewpoint of "normals" outside of cryptocoin world

[01-Apr-19 10:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
i don't understand their funding model

[01-Apr-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so this could all be a big marketing stunt to get a lot of attention, sell at crazy valuation (more than KMD) and then realize it isnt cost effective to do 100,000 BTC tx/day notarizing a single chain

[01-Apr-19 10:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
who pays for their office by the beach?

[01-Apr-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
they raised $18 million

[01-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
$5 million paid to advisor/endorsers

[01-Apr-19 10:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe the devs actually think it's a good idea? It seems like wealthy biz-savvy people just doing their normal thing, but now with cryptocoins
