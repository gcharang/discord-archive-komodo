could be, seems you can't  connect to it

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
may need to use a vpn if you can't connect to any of them

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] wookie#7663
can a vpn hide me from my service provider?

[02-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Alright#0419
they can't block traffic if you use a VPN

[02-Sep-18 06:40 PM] wookie#7663
but can they know where I'm visiting and who I am?

[02-Sep-18 06:40 PM] wookie#7663
sorry, but the stratum.komodo.services didn't connect either

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
if you use a VPN properly, your ISP can only see that you're using a VPN, that's it

[02-Sep-18 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
some VPNs are better than others for privacy, if you plan on getting one, pm me

@acp what is your pool's `KMDversion` from `getinfo` call?

Anyone else find it odd that "Awesome Miner" doesn't accept crypto as payment?

[03-Sep-18 04:23 PM] $tefano.#3560
pool has banned many addresses with fake shares today.

[03-Sep-18 04:27 PM] $tefano.#3560
"50 out of the last 50 shares were invalid" 
please contact me in PM if you want so i can help you

[03-Sep-18 04:29 PM] $tefano.#3560
if you use VPN probably address is banned for some other reasons

[03-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Voight#4922
Guys is it rational to mine with cpu?

[03-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Cryptoon#3362
No 😦

@Cryptoon thnx

[03-Sep-18 06:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
It’s a gpu optimized algorithm

[03-Sep-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
@Voight you could mine VRSC

[03-Sep-18 06:30 PM] Alright#0419
their hashing algo is optimized for CPUs

@Alright I guess it was solo mining

[03-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, what?

[03-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Alright#0419
VRSC has pools now

[03-Sep-18 06:31 PM] Voight#4922
@Alright oh there wasnt last i checked. Thanx, i will look

[07-Sep-18 04:13 PM] meatspoon#7860
Can someone recommend a KMD pool that is easy to get going in?  I used suprnova months ago, prior to the software upgrade but I couldn’t get my batch file right after the update. Pretty noobish, so i am looking for a pool that has super clear instructions on how my batch file should read. Thanks.

[07-Sep-18 04:20 PM] Alright#0419
what mining software are you using @meatspoon

[07-Sep-18 04:22 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I can help you out too @meatspoon

[07-Sep-18 04:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
I am not at home right now. I have an old Nvidia gaming rig.  I have tried a few different mining programs, none with luck tho since earlier this year. I am open to whatever, tho. Dont mind downloading something new. My problem usually lies with there being insufficient instruction on how to write the batch file.

[07-Sep-18 04:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
what operating system?

[07-Sep-18 04:30 PM] meatspoon#7860
I want to say Windows 7, 64 bit

[07-Sep-18 04:33 PM] xRobeSx#5136
@meatspoon there's download links for the EWBF miner on that thread. 

then your  start.bat should be something like this `miner --server stratum.komodo.services --user <yourKMDaddress>.MyWorker --pass x --port 3333` from what I've found. 

That's my pool, but you can change it for others.

[07-Sep-18 04:59 PM] meatspoon#7860
Thanks, when i get home i will try the suggestions. I am sure i will find some way to muck it up, so i will likely pester y’all with questions. Thanks again.

[07-Sep-18 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
does anyone know the operator of mining4.co.uk pool?

[07-Sep-18 05:18 PM] meatspoon#7860
ok, i am back.  so before I go reinventing the wheel here, I currently have the nheqminer-btg.  And I am currently set up on Suprnova.  so if anyone could help me get the text of my batch file correct, that might be easiest solution...?

[07-Sep-18 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
what's your current batch file look like

[07-Sep-18 05:22 PM] meatspoon#7860
its a mess.  heh...
nheqminer.exe -l stratum+tcp://kmd.suprnova.cc:6250 -u RUe6vtr4WzKV7E7uK21wtSuYyeysGgxdEQ.meatspoon.Desktop -p meat

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
`nheqminer.exe -l stratum+tcp://stratum.komodo.services:3333 -u RUe6vtr4WzKV7E7uK21wtSuYyeysGgxdEQ.meatspoon -p meat`
should work I think

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] meatspoon#7860
i got to the point where i was just making random changes, heh

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
not familiar with nhequiminer tbh

[07-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Alright#0419
oh that didn't work previously?

[07-Sep-18 05:24 PM] meatspoon#7860
no, i have a really hard time finding posts from people who use Suprnova (or any other pool for that matter).  I need my damn hand held!  hah

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
one would think Suprnova would just give an example of the batch file text on their site

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i think what @Alright posted should work. I think the error with the one he posted was the `.meatspoon.desktop` (2 worker names) but not sure if that's allowed

[07-Sep-18 05:25 PM] meatspoon#7860
when i run it right now i am getting a repeating message saying "resolve: the specified class was not found"

[07-Sep-18 05:26 PM] meatspoon#7860
then it tries to reconnect.

[07-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
I edited, what I posted originally

[07-Sep-18 05:26 PM] Alright#0419
try what's there now

[07-Sep-18 05:27 PM] meatspoon#7860
still same error message

[07-Sep-18 05:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
i am using the "start_1gpu.bat" file for this, dunno if that matters

[07-Sep-18 05:28 PM] meatspoon#7860
there is a start_2gpu.bat file as well, but I only have one card

[09-Sep-18 05:40 PM] Baka#2988
Anyone knoe if it is possible to mine komodo with asic ( z9 mini )
I have used supernova pool on hpu but doesn't seem to accept shares if i set up the z9 as a worker?
Sorry if this is a silly q, am new to mining.
Cheers.

[09-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Baka its possible

[09-Sep-18 05:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[09-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
@Baka yes, totally possible

[09-Sep-18 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
just a minute, I'll show you an example

[09-Sep-18 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
for URL you could do something like `stratum+tcp://stratum.komodo.services:3333`

{Reactions}
👍 

[09-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
for worker put your KMD address

[09-Sep-18 06:00 PM] Alright#0419
for password put anything

[10-Sep-18 12:16 AM] Baka#2988
Awesome thanks guys! I'll try the url above when home later. I think i was using port:6250 at the end of url from memory. Also might try changing username.workerid to my actual wallet address. Cheers :)

Anyone know of a program that's the opposite of Bitmain's "IP Reporter"? One where I can know the IP of an errant rig and make it beep so that it can be located...

[11-Sep-18 11:57 AM] coinr#7073
New to kmd.  Have some 1080ti's and 1070s, is it worth mining on right now?  Whats the daily return currently with one 1080ti.  Thanks guys

[11-Sep-18 11:59 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Whats the daily return currently with one 1080ti. `
@coinr 0.2664 KMD (if I math right)

[11-Sep-18 12:07 PM] coinr#7073

[11-Sep-18 12:07 PM] coinr#7073
Thanks bud

[11-Sep-18 04:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So... is everyone solo mining with their Z9s?  Seems better than joining a big pool if you have a few rigs, yeah?

[11-Sep-18 04:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
my rule of thumb is never join a public pool if you have enough hash to get at least 1 block a month

{Reactions}
🐙 

[11-Sep-18 05:10 PM] coinr#7073
Risk mitigation.  One month is too much of a long shot for me.  If its a hobby, then i guess thats fine but pools for larger hash coins average out to the same anyway over long periods

[11-Sep-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@coinr Provided you have the hashrate to cover the overhead without digging into your own pocket (aka "one block per month"), if you enter into a public pool you are only accomplishing 3 things:
1) providing for some random stranger's retirement fund
2) helping to centralize hashrate
3) giving up all consensus rights in the efforts of 1) and 2)

[11-Sep-18 05:21 PM] coinr#7073
Yeah i get it, but that "overhead cost" is a killer when you are spinning a lot of machines.

[11-Sep-18 05:22 PM] coinr#7073
2 or 3 bad months is brutal

Literally a shitton of money on electric.  hah.  Is this resi or commercial?

[11-Sep-18 05:29 PM] coinr#7073
You getting any of the regular 9s?

[11-Sep-18 05:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
probably not, since space isn't an issue, minis are still a better bet for me

[11-Sep-18 05:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I have 2 minis I ordered later than the rest.  
Paid big tarrif and they don't seem as stable above 625.    Thankfully I can OC them.

[11-Sep-18 05:30 PM] coinr#7073

[11-Sep-18 05:31 PM] coinr#7073
Fishy on a solo or pool?

[11-Sep-18 05:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The smallest pool I can find.

[11-Sep-18 05:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Only one other rig there with me.
