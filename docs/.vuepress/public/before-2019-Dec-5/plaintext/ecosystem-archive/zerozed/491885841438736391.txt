Thank you @jl777c

I've got a million things needing doing first, but KMD ties into my tech quite heavily so I really appreciating been given a space here.

[19-Sep-18 08:26 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
My focus since 2013 is trying to figure out a fair and economicaly sound inflation model for crypto currency.

[19-Sep-18 08:27 AM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I have a few pieces of writing up around the place. If people want to jump in and see what we are about. I'll leave an invite to our discord as well.

I plan on creating an asset chain on KMD as well. x0z is essentialy just Bitcoin ABC but rebooted from genisis and uses a completely different inflation algo. I've also thrown in an 8% premine which will become heavily diluted in the second year. This is for 2 reasons. funding the project for the 5 year inflation cycle, and so we hold enough supply to prevent any.. issue's..

[19-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
by the time we get 2.5 years in, most of the premine will be dispersed by hiring devs and for faucets and all that oldschool stuff we use to love

[19-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
gonna organise time locked multisig address for the community funds

[19-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
what else

[19-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
atomic swaps.. yeah i want to make a sistercoin so to speak, so i have both an asset chain on kmd and x0z, that way i can play with interop experiments and not risk other peoples projects trying my stupid ideas

[19-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
I first came here looking for help a few months back asking about to get my scrypt pow network exchanging on barterdex.

[19-Sep-18 12:11 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
through that, jl777 pointed out an issue in my code which im now endevouring to fix before to many start to notice me

[19-Sep-18 12:11 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
and thats my story

[19-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Calem | [x0z] | zero-zed.com#5181
tldr

`What is needed is an alternative to Tether that is built on it’s own Proof-of-work backbone in order to break away from the ties to the US Dollars out of control inflation. Using the Diffusion of Innovations to base an inflation model, along with an industry supported tried and true mining algorithm and cross-chain transactions such as the Atomic Swap network on the Komodo (KMD) platform, a potential now exists to solve a long time debated issue surrounding not just volatility but how to achieve successful diffusion whilst maintaining the normal distribution and a standard score of 0z. In other words how do we create a stable crypto-currency that is, relatively speaking, evenly dispersed between everyone alive once new coins cease production.`

If anyone sees merit in the idea, and can code, i could do with the help. I need to test this out in 2 more coins plus a kmd asset chain. I already half a team at zerozed so we run a tiny exchange and a couple of pools. I literaly just need anyone who can work with C++
