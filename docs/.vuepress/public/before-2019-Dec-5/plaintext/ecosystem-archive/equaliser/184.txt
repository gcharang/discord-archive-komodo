[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> EQL is demand based, no set block time.

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> thanks

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> So generally it clears real quick. Should be even faster now that several of y'all have full nodes running 😄

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> 19 min and counting 😄

[dscrdeql] <Bulgarius> Hi 👋

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Was it you that bought the 30K at next to nothing?

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> when sending and receiving its pretty much instant unless you use exrates of course

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> lol

[25-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Right?

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> i think if u get bigger value take longer

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah i have sent a few times.. its real quick

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> yesterday i got aprox 1500 EQL and take 13 min

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> first time I withdrew from here to test the Agama wallet it was instant

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> yeah, you might be right on that Thorth.

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> today 3300 and 21 min and still counting

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> and when I deposited into here it was pretty instant

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> well @CombatWombat  everyone whats money 😂

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <!👽⎝╲⎝⧹⎝╲⎝⧹𝔗𝔥𝔬𝔯𝔱𝔥⧸⎠╱⎠⧸⎠╱⎠👽> is harder to pay 😂

[25-Jul-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> They might have a manual threshold that has to be pulled from cold storage. Old method, but hey, they're not the most up to date exchange 😛

[25-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CombatWombat> yeah but exrates does things manually which is why it takes so long

[25-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Supposedly they're revamping the whole thing and adding a public API within the next few weeks.

[25-Jul-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> Hopefully get their withdrawl fees down in line with the rest of the market while they're at it.

[25-Jul-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <MassimoStyle> Thanks for the rain

[25-Jul-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
