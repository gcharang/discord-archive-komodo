[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, it's exciting to see that price movement

[17-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Let's hope we keep it up this time

[17-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Indeed I managed to get a decent bunch between 14-15 sats enough to put me atm in the 20s rich list

[17-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> What happened to the rich list?

[17-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> I was like 51 or 52

[17-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I might get a little extra later this year so maybe I can help again on setting a good buy order, but for now I've filled my baggs

[17-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yep I’m ok for now with how much I have got

[17-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Let’s see how it goes up from here

[17-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> If *

[17-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> scroll up and you will see about the 'richlist'

[17-Sep-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> @✌Jellysmash✌  I saw it now ahah was wondering how I entered from being number 50 to the 20s just like that 🙈

[17-Sep-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Thank you for the info .

[17-Sep-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Sep-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Damn, almost all supply is in top 100 list

[17-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hope that changes when we get listed on a new exchange

[17-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But you can see at this list that hardly anyone has really bought yet

[17-Sep-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And those we did, bought a big amount I would think

[17-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye when we have more exchanges we will get more liquidity and that will change for sure

[17-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But to be honest, it's nice to be on the top100 for once haha

[17-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Even my discord balance makes the top 100 😂

[17-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ye we have to enjoy while it last probability in 6 months time it’s gonna be much harder to be on that top 100 that’s for sure .

[17-Sep-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think most of us will have no hard trouble to stay in I think

[17-Sep-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> But who knows, if it spreads out to many people it might be

[17-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> thanks @Buddz1993

[17-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yes , but the newer people that come at a later stage will have a much harder time to even be in top 100 😃

[17-Sep-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> yea, be way more expensive to get into the top 100

[17-Sep-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> that can only be a good thing for all of us hodlers when it happens 😃

[17-Sep-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> On Monday  need more coffee!

[17-Sep-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> i here you

[17-Sep-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Yes for sure ..

[17-Sep-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> hear, even 😃

[17-Sep-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> feeling my usual mildly lobotomised monday after a good weekend

[17-Sep-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> What I tend to do is not drinking any coffee until my eyes start to shut down from the tiredness ahah

[17-Sep-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> And then I get a big boost and I’m good as new

[17-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Usually works for me 😅

[17-Sep-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> yeah - problem i have with that method is the amount of coffee required!!

[17-Sep-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> just need to find a way to give up the day job so concept of Monday doesn't plague me in the same way 😃

[17-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Ahaha I wished I could quit my Dayjob and start my own company but as me there are milions that think the same way 😄

[17-Sep-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Or even billions

[17-Sep-18 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> indeed!

[17-Sep-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <K00l1> hi

[17-Sep-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Hey 😃

[17-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <miles> no idea on those names @SwimedDragon - not seen them before

[17-Sep-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> good evening!

[17-Sep-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ghøst> Monday - as two working days

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i like these exrates trades at 20sats and higher

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> 📈 💪 :EQLI:

[17-Sep-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> it doesnt take much money to get your bag peeps

[17-Sep-18 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> I miss being able to pick them up for 6 or 7 though haha, it’s bitter sweet in a way

[17-Sep-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> We had our chances to load up from there 😃

[17-Sep-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> And I hope others see what they missed out on if they didn't buy and joined for the rains only

[17-Sep-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's still not too late

[17-Sep-18 04:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Get your EQLI cheap while it lasts, once we get more exchanges and good news, price will go up 😃

[17-Sep-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Exactly, the train is leaving the station, but your tickets now

[17-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Completely aggree people I don’t think we will see those 10-15 level sats any time soon or I would say nearly impossible for us to go that low

[17-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> i always have bids in 10sats and lower. the cost to buy down there is so low it seems silly not to jsut incase someone pukes

[17-Sep-18 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> when people come for them +100sats and for +1000sats i will gladly sell them a few here and there but im a long term believer

[17-Sep-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Once I recoup my cost for buying EQLI I plan to hold for a while as well

[17-Sep-18 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Zach> Or HODL if you prefer

[17-Sep-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hello alll

[17-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> hello @x2maano

[17-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> how are you today

[17-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> hmmm

[17-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> feeling weak

[17-Sep-18 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> tired

[17-Sep-18 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 😫

[17-Sep-18 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Indeed

[17-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> sleep may help with the weak feeling

[17-Sep-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I find doing weights really helps with that

[17-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> when forcing myself to do something, then afterwards feel much better

[17-Sep-18 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <x2maano> 👍
