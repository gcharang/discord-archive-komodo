@Deleted User  I can't prove it doesn't work, and no one else has either.
It is easy to prove something is broken, but very difficult to prove it isn't.

[22-Mar-19 06:50 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what is bad question?

[22-Mar-19 06:50 PM] zack#6467
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  in Amoveo an oracle can result in 3 alternatives. True or False or BadQuestion.

[22-Mar-19 06:51 PM] zack#6467
The smart contracts for betting are programmed so that if the result is bad_question, the bet is undone. each participant gets back out the money they had put in.

[22-Mar-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
seems most of them are badquestion

[22-Mar-19 06:51 PM] MyName#0491
`I can't prove it doesn't work, and no one else has either.`
Wasn't that your base premise? that it didn't work ("scam")?

[22-Mar-19 06:52 PM] zack#6467
bad question is in the middle, in a topological sense. it starts there, and then once people can start doing reporting, it usually moves to true or false.

[22-Mar-19 06:52 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
here's some orace visualisation from a cluster of chains on the host. Verifiable by anyone with thier own native node - sourced from local

[22-Mar-19 06:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
http://oracle.earth/ntx_graph/

[22-Mar-19 06:53 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
what parameters define `bad question`, or its transition to `true/false`

[22-Mar-19 06:54 PM] zack#6467
there are a bunch of parameters determined by a governance mechanism.
The tool for changing governance values works more or less the same as the oracle tool.

[22-Mar-19 06:54 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
is it a participant threshold? or more to it?

[22-Mar-19 06:54 PM] zack#6467
true makes the governance value increse, false decreases it, and bad-question it stays the same

[22-Mar-19 06:54 PM] zack#6467
a quantity of veo threshold

[22-Mar-19 06:55 PM] zack#6467
you can bet on true/false/bad-question.
bets are always matched at 1:1 price.
So there is only 1 kind of bet in the order book at a time.

[22-Mar-19 06:55 PM] zack#6467
the kind of bet in the order book determines how the oracle will result if it closes now.

[22-Mar-19 06:56 PM] zack#6467
there is also a timer that restarts every time the state of the oracle changes.
so if it is in true now, and you make some bets to change it to bad-question, then the timer resets.

[22-Mar-19 06:56 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so it oscilates around true and false on each successive bet?

[22-Mar-19 06:56 PM] zack#6467
it is a first come first server order book.

[22-Mar-19 06:57 PM] zack#6467
if there are a lot of orders sitting in the book, then it probably wont switch types again.

[22-Mar-19 07:06 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so there is a nominal qty of tickets on either side?

[22-Mar-19 07:07 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
where does the shortfall come from at 2:1 odds without a blanced book? variable ticket value?

[22-Mar-19 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
*Thinking to myself:*
TBF - I have always loved VEO since Pondsea introduced me a year ago.  
It always made me wonder if KMD multichain architecture could have helped Zack with a lot of things along the way giving him an accelerated development environment.   

Having all these Devs as a sounding board but ultimately able to to control the outcome of his own Project.

@KomodoPlatform @dukeleto @PirateChain @SerendipityXBT They agree with me that their "oracle" is actually equivalent to a trusted feed.
They just call it an "oracle" for marketing purposes.

[22-Mar-19 07:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
You also said you get to decide incorrect oracle states.   How is that any less trusted?

[22-Mar-19 07:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If not worse?

[22-Mar-19 07:28 PM] zack#6467
@siu - Chainmakers  the block reward is set by the governance mechanism. the governance mechanism kept lowering the reward.

[22-Mar-19 07:28 PM] zack#6467
I don't get to decide anything any more than any other participant in Amoveo.

[22-Mar-19 07:30 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Why the bullshitting?

[22-Mar-19 07:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Veo users can vote on mechanisms such as dev reward %.  Block reward and other items.

[22-Mar-19 07:31 PM] zack#6467
there is no voting in Amoveo

@FishyGuts Are you still not seeing the FUD? 🤔

[22-Mar-19 07:31 PM] zack#6467
we use futarchy

Theoretically if “everyone is gaming the system, no one can game the system”

[22-Mar-19 07:32 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Is the “moral governance” mechanism.

[22-Mar-19 07:32 PM] zack#6467
Ignoring your own short coming is a sure way to prevent yourself from improving @MyName   
People like me who help find flaws are helping to make Komodo better.

[22-Mar-19 07:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I hope you’re feeling the exact same way boss. 👍

[22-Mar-19 07:33 PM] FishyGuts#5085

@zack you alone decide consensus of the network

[22-Mar-19 07:34 PM] zack#6467
That isn't the result that I get when I look at the math.

[22-Mar-19 07:35 PM] MyName#0491
@zack There's a significant difference between "finding flaws" and you outright lying to make your product look "better" (even after you admitted your oracles' "truth" can be bought and paid for)

[22-Mar-19 07:35 PM] zack#6467
having more money doesn't give you the ability to force the outcome of an Amoveo oracle.

[22-Mar-19 07:36 PM] MyName#0491
`having more money doesn't give you the ability to force the outcome of an Amoveo oracle.`
You literally said that someone can pay you to call the opposing data a lie and manually issue a centralized "hard update"

[22-Mar-19 07:36 PM] zack#6467
I don't see how pointing out flaws in Komodo makes Amoveo look any better.
Amoveo improves indirectly in that I get to practice explaining oracles.

[22-Mar-19 07:36 PM] Alright#0419
`By default, nodes will go with the fork that has the most difficulty, but it is easy to manually tell your node to follow a different fork. The developers promise to maintain the honest fork. ` From your whitepaper

[22-Mar-19 07:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

It seems like someone is doing the rambling for marketing purposes

[22-Mar-19 07:37 PM] zack#6467
Yesterday I realized that we can combine probabilistic payments with the lightning network to make a better alternative instead of the hub and spoke network

[22-Mar-19 07:37 PM] MyName#0491
`Amoveo improves indirectly in that I get to practice explaining oracles.`
All you "explained" is that you are willing to prostitute your system, literally the opposite of trustless

[22-Mar-19 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
lets stop with the name calling. we just need to agree to disagree

[22-Mar-19 07:38 PM] MyName#0491
who's name calling?

[22-Mar-19 07:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Please, stkp the bullshitting, you dont have any type of demonstrqble qdvantage over komodo tech

[22-Mar-19 07:39 PM] zack#6467
Does komodo use hub and spoke? have you guys heard of probabilistic payments?
I think this is going to be some important tech soon

[22-Mar-19 07:39 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
All you have is a betting dapp

[22-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
One of our ecosystem projects, CHIPS, uses spoke and hub lightning network for p2p poker

[22-Mar-19 07:39 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This is degenerating.   It was good discussion before but now it’s gotten off track.   

Name calling doesn’t have to be direct.   Insinuating negative connotations with things is going too far probably.

[22-Mar-19 07:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Back on track is preferred

[22-Mar-19 07:40 PM] zack#6467
do they have poker off-chain inside the channels? Because that makes it unsuitable for the probabilistic payment upgrade.

[22-Mar-19 07:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He tweeted that we accept that oracles is a marketing thing, that is bs

[22-Mar-19 07:41 PM] zack#6467
Another cool use of probabilistic payments is to overcome the altruistic full node problem.
Like, why does a full node share blocks for free?
I think this is some very cool tech that could be useful in a lot of different projects

[22-Mar-19 07:41 PM] MyName#0491
`Name calling doesn’t have to be direct. Insinuating negative connotations with things is going too far probably.`
I'm open to replace the "offensive" word with whatever synonym you'd prefer that fits " to devote to corrupt or unworthy purposes for money" (I'm feeling OK with being PC atm)

[22-Mar-19 07:43 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is great, bring the constructive things, but please stop the misleading statements

you don't have much room to criticize if the consensus of your network is based on a promise

[22-Mar-19 07:45 PM] zack#6467
The consensus is not based on a promise. I am not sure why you would think that.

[22-Mar-19 07:46 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its a literal quote from your whitepaper

[22-Mar-19 07:46 PM] MyName#0491
`Describing a centralized source of information as if it is trust-free and decentralized is unethical.`
then why do you claim your system is trust-free and decentralized? are you unethical or does that only apply to your competition?

Well, when you're done thinking and actually add it, then maybe you have a leg to stand on to call Komodo a "lie" but until then yours is no "better" or "lessor" of a "lie"

[22-Mar-19 07:48 PM] zack#6467
you are encouraging me to call Komodo a lie once I write this code for probabilistic payments?

[22-Mar-19 07:49 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He is just saying that oracles is something else that it isnt and then wants us to be the liars for using the term correctly. wtf

[22-Mar-19 07:49 PM] zack#6467
Actually, I am trying to share this probabilistic payment technology, which I think could be useful in many of your projects

[22-Mar-19 07:50 PM] MyName#0491
That I can pay you to issue a "hard update" to determine that an opposing oracle is "lying" and my "truth" is the truth, it the epitome of what you're accusing Komodo of being (in fact even worse)

[22-Mar-19 07:51 PM] MyName#0491
Your entire system is manipulable, trusted, and centralized (by your own words)

[22-Mar-19 07:51 PM] zack#6467
You are going to pay me to do a hard update to Amoveo? What do you want changed?
I might have to setup a futarchy market first, to make sure the community is on board, but we can probably make this happen. As long as your plan isn't too crazy.

[22-Mar-19 07:52 PM] zack#6467
If  I like the idea, I might do it for free

[22-Mar-19 07:52 PM] MyName#0491
@Alright directly questioned you at least 5 times about how you justify a "hard update" as not being centralized and you ignored him every time

[22-Mar-19 07:52 PM] MyName#0491
because it's the epitome of centralized

[22-Mar-19 07:52 PM] zack#6467
oh, you are concerned that the step of hard updating isn't decentralized enough in the Amoveo oracle?
Great question

[22-Mar-19 07:53 PM] zack#6467
Some other users in Amoveo have been discussing this very same issue, there is even a proposal on how to do it a little differently.

[22-Mar-19 07:54 PM] MyName#0491
One can't invent a better example of "centralized" than that you, as 1 man, get to decide if your oracle is "lying"

[22-Mar-19 07:54 PM] zack#6467
They are saying that we should have a command in the full node so that you can instruct the full node to refuse to sync any block that closes an oracle in a way the the operator of the full node has decided would be a lie.

[22-Mar-19 07:54 PM] zack#6467
Personally, I think that this interface will be too confusing for most users. They would prefer to just have different github repositories for the different forks to choose between.

[22-Mar-19 07:54 PM] zack#6467
This is a great area for further exploration on how to improve Amoveo

[22-Mar-19 07:55 PM] Alright#0419

you are talking about the exchanges? We use Qtrade and A1 exchange for Amoveo

[22-Mar-19 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
Any time we raise a valid criticism, you go "oh we're discussing a way to fix that"

[22-Mar-19 07:56 PM] Alright#0419
it's a one sided conversation here

[22-Mar-19 07:56 PM] zack#6467
Generally for a hard update, first I discuss with the mining pools until we can find a version of the update that we are confident everyone else will approve of.
If it is even slightly controversial, we make a futarchy market to double-check that the community actually wants this update.

[22-Mar-19 07:56 PM] MyName#0491
`They are saying that we should have a command in the full node so that you can instruct the full node to refuse to sync any block that closes an oracle in a way the the operator of the full node has decided would be a lie.`
If you do that, some bored jackwagon will create a scenario where each of your oracles will be on a different fork and the entire system will come to a screaming halt
