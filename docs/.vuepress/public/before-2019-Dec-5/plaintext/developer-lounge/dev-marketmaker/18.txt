@Mylo , to reduce the final image you can try removing the Rust compiler and source code (/root/.rustup, /mm2 and /root/.cargo) and build that image with `--squash`.

[24-Jul-19 04:14 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
If your Docker version doesn't have the `--squash` yet then you'll need to combine the RUN steps into a single RUN step, removing said paths at the end of it.

[24-Jul-19 04:18 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/ can also be used, returing to just the Ubuntu layer with the mm2 binary at the end.

Does anyone know if a 'setprice' will match another setprice order? Example: there is a maker order on the books selling 1 KMD for 1 BTC. If I post another setprice selling say 1.1 BTC for 1 KMD, will they match?

[24-Jul-19 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
probably not

[24-Jul-19 05:27 PM] jansako#3330

[24-Jul-19 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you would want to fill any such order first

[24-Jul-19 05:29 PM] jansako#3330
so you really want to do a buy/sell order first, and let it auto-convert if it does not fill?

[24-Jul-19 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
seems so

[24-Jul-19 06:14 PM] jansako#3330
A weird one: Why would one use the 'sell' over the 'buy' command? they both seem to do the same thing just with the opposite pair. I mean you can just swap the base pair and use only sell, or only buy. So what is the use case of one over another?

Hi folks. So I am watching the printout from MM2 as the swaps are running. (CLI tail on Ubuntu) It seems the time stamp is one hour off from my PC time. Does MM2 just use a specific time zone (looks like GMT?) for everyone or is it s configuration issue? I can see a possible issue if an application needs to keep track of swaps for tax purposes etc. (so the trades can be placed into the correct tax period in example) You don't want to put your profit cashing pout swap into an wrong tax year...

for global trading there needs to be some standard timestamp, unixtime, which is UTC

that was not a complaint, just a clarification request. Pretty sure a smart GUI can compensate for it 😃

[25-Jul-19 04:03 PM] jansako#3330
By the way, really nice work on MM2. it has been running for a week nonstop, no hiccups like MM1!  Swaps are happening too!

[25-Jul-19 04:18 PM] jansako#3330
Question:
If I create a maker order with the 'max' parameter for the trade volume, will this adjust dynamically? As in if I place an order for both buy and sell side with a spread, will they 'dynamically refill each other' as swaps happen, or will MM2 just place an order with a fixed MAX depending on how much I have available at the moment??

[25-Jul-19 04:19 PM] jansako#3330
In other words, is the 'max' parameter a specific number set at the time of order creation, or 'max at the time a swap is being initiated'?

[25-Jul-19 04:22 PM] cipi#4502
atm, it uses the amount you have by the time the order is created, but there is already an issue open for this: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/417
i personally update the orders every 30s, because prices change anyway, so it does not bother me :-)
when you call setprice again old orders are being deleted by default

We have two kind of logs, GUI logs, intended for the user (our UI doesn't share them yet, but I keep hoping that it will), and debugging logs which are not intended for end users, but should be shared with the developers when things go rogue. The GUI logs are using the local time ( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/a5b1d5776428ddc254cc1c3a0baf24bea6abe293/mm2src/common/log.rs#L295 ) but the debugging logs are using the UTC ( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/a5b1d5776428ddc254cc1c3a0baf24bea6abe293/mm2src/common/log.rs#L168 ) in order for the devs to make sense of when the things have actually happened.

From the mm2 DEX API docs (https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#my_recent_swaps) I had assumed that after an “error event” occurs, a swap fails. Yesterday I was looking at lp_swap.rs and found that swaps seem to be able to recover after an error event  (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/a5b1d5776428ddc254cc1c3a0baf24bea6abe293/mm2src/lp_swap.rs#L622). Could someone explain the "save swap" process to me? Do any error events prevent the swap from being saved? Does the swap uuid change? Is the last event (even after an error) in my_swap_status always "Finished"?

Thanks for the ping, @hyperDEX.

> and found that swaps seem to be able to recover after an error event

I might very well be mistaken, but I don't see how this follows from the link. `SavedSwap` is used to continue with the SWAP after the MarketMaker was stopped. This might be particularly useful on mobile, where the operating systems are free to kick us out whenever, and the ability to continue with the SWAP gives us a chance to finish it when the user returns to the app.

[26-Jul-19 10:49 PM] artemciy_dice#0049

`> Do any error events prevent the swap from being saved?`

I think not. Events are serialized regardless of whether they are good or bad.

`> Does the swap uuid change?`

No.

`> Is the last event (even after an error) in my_swap_status always "Finished"?`

It should be, though it might be finished with error.
If the SWAP is never finished, it might indicate a condition we don't know how to handle yet, or a bug.

Noob alert! I successfully completed a Rick and Morty swap via cli following the fine documentation of "AtomicDEX Walkthrough". I'll note that, following instructions, the marketmaker is installed in ~/atomicDEX-API, but the documentation makes a few references to commands to be issued in ~/komodoplatform.  This ought to be changed.

@artemciy_dice You're right, I misunderstood the meaning of "SavedSwap." Looking over the code again, it seems that after an error occurs, the "Finished" event is saved (as you said).

[30-Jul-19 08:05 AM] jansako#3330
Morning folks.  I would like a bit of clarification on two scenarios:
1. orders appear to persist on the books when MM2 is stopped and restarted. I see this with the CLI and the Chainmakers app. 
- set a 'setprice' order
- issue the 'mm2 stop' command, see the confirmation
- wait a while, issue MM2 start order
- check orderbooks, the original order is still there.
Questions 
- is this expected?
- if yes, how to properly clear orders from the orderbook? 
- are these orders fillable?
- If we get people creating orders, then shutting down their MM2 (using AtomicDex, i.e.), we will have a ton of garbage orders in the books with no way of knowing which ones are real

[30-Jul-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Hello @jansako ! Yes, it's expected behaviour that mm2 recreating orders on startup and these orders are fillable as long as your maker is online.
To clear orders:
cancelling all orders: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#cancel-all-orders
cancelling specific order: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#cancel-all-orders

OK. Will the order disappear from the books if your MM is shut down?

[30-Jul-19 08:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it should dissapear I think. If you can test this case and share the results it would be very great contribution

[30-Jul-19 08:11 AM] jansako#3330
I will try. Thank you!

[30-Jul-19 08:17 AM] jansako#3330
Second scenario:
- have 100KMD
- create two setprice orders for to buy two different coins for 99.9 KMD each
- one order is filled, now my KMD balance is 0.01 (less tx fees), but I still have a buy order on the other coin for 99.9 KMD
- the second order is now not fillable (cause I have no balance), but still shows on the books (so it is a 'fake' or 'dummy' order)

Q: what is the expected behavior of MM2 in this case?

[30-Jul-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
This trade will fail on maker transaction sending

[30-Jul-19 08:19 AM] jansako#3330
that is what I thought. a larger number of these will cause user experience issues because the users will not know why orders are failing etc...

[30-Jul-19 08:19 AM] jansako#3330
Doo you know if this is being addressed on the dev side?

[30-Jul-19 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
```- create two setprice orders for to buy two different coins for 99.9 KMD each
- one order is filled, now my KMD balance is 0.01 (less tx fees), but I still have a buy order on the other coin for 99.9 KMD
- the second order is now not fillable
- the second order is now not fillable (cause I have no balance), but still shows on the books (so it is a 'fake' or 'dummy' order)```
if order still displaying in orderbook in such case I think it should be improved and you can open issue on GH to get feedback from mm2 devs

[30-Jul-19 08:20 AM] jansako#3330

[30-Jul-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to have the mm2 node periodically scan all its offers and make sure they are all fully funded and if not to reduce the volume

[30-Jul-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
this should not be hard to do and very necessary part of liquidity multiplier. only the edge case when 2 open orders for the same funds are starting a swap at the same time should there be any error

[30-Jul-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, whenever an order is started that uses up funds. immediately all other orders needs to be adjusted. there is no need for polling

[30-Jul-19 08:36 AM] jansako#3330
Would be great if it can be done the other way around as well (increase the order size if more funds become available)

[30-Jul-19 08:37 AM] jansako#3330

makerpayment: https://dex.kmdexplorer.io/tx/f7160576c9bb4f2b0246194f9d8c210159f92e964ecb3a79b6fd2279176c7b88
takerpayment: https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/bd72f11e06e42d031c8cf5b10e251427cdb6ad82f527bfb24fdf68f3cfff8dd7
the swap should have continued with maker spending the takerpayment, but that never happened, so it looks like the maker died after that

My maker doesn't show dead. It's responding to my calls. Should I restart it and reenable?

strange... i would leave it running, see what happens after some time has passed
