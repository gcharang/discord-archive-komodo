iguana doesnt work with 0.17 in any case

[16-Mar-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so you wouldnt have got much further

[16-Mar-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
they do it on purpose

[16-Mar-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
to them backward compatibility is something that must be avoided. i think their plan is to use up as much dev time from altcoins as they can as this is the best way they have to prolong their advantage. sad, really.

[16-Mar-19 12:42 PM] Lumbi#8378
why not switch to ETH or LTC or a combination thereof for dPoW?

[16-Mar-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
why change to lower hashrate chains?

[16-Mar-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW works now, has been. making it worse only makes it worse

[16-Mar-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if it aint broke, dont fix it and certainly dont make it worse

Would I need a fixed ip for a NN server or would DDNS be sufficient?

[17-Mar-19 03:14 AM] SHossain#0007
you need a static ip

[17-Mar-19 03:14 AM] Strob#3417
ok thanks

[17-Mar-19 04:14 AM] Strob#3417
Also I'm curious about what "easy mining" means for the NN.  I saw it's only cpu mining, but will a faster cpu mine more than the other nodes?

[17-Mar-19 04:22 AM] Strob#3417
Ok cool! tx

[17-Mar-19 04:26 AM] Strob#3417
Ok interesting.

hi, I have 1 question about the setup Komodo notary node guide , at this step : 
"Copy these files then change them from using port 7778 to 7776"
`cp ~/SuperNET/iguana/coins/btc ~/SuperNET/iguana/
cp ~/SuperNET/iguana/coins/kmd ~/SuperNET/iguana/`

[17-Mar-19 11:49 AM] PHBA2061#2530
I should change the original files or the copied ones ?

[17-Mar-19 12:43 PM] eclips#1570

```KNIP: Komodo Notary Improvement Proposal 0.0.1

To shift KMD NN elections towards a more meritocratic and less simplistic model, the following proposals are made: 

I. Notary Bonus:
All notaries from the previous year get 5,000 Vote2019; provided that:
1. they cannot vote for themselves
2. their votes are public
3. only 50% of their votes can go to notaries from the previous year. The remaining 50% of votes must be cast on new candidates.
4. failure to follow the above rules would nullify a notary's votes   

II. Active KMD community votes
To qualify as an active member, (non-notary) members must navigate to the #Vote2019 channel of the KMD discord and answer a series of questions about KMD. Those that complete the test and provide a valid address get 3,000 vote tokens.

III. KMD Hodler votes
All hodlers of KMD automatically get Vote2019 tokens on the basis of an exchanged rate of 100 KMD = 1 Vote2019

IV. Candidacy  limitations
Ideally there would be 64 separate NN run buy 64 qualified individual notaries. To achieve this goal, notary candidates may only run for one region. Should there not be enough qualified candidates on the first round, a second round of voting should be held. In the second round, existing notaries may run for a second spot. 1 notary should be limited to a max of 2 nodes. Additionally, candidates  should be automatically disqualified if they share personal or family relations to elected notaries.  "Gifting" votes to third parties is forbidden and would likewise result in disqualification.```

[18-Mar-19 09:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
why kmd to vote not 1:1 for hodlers? At 100:1 , the other proposed bonuses are orders of magnitude greater than actually holding.

[18-Mar-19 09:49 AM] Lumbi#8378
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  the exchange rate makes a statement that votes can't be bought 1:1 ( and it would encourage those relying on such a strategy to buy more)  😉 ...

[18-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Lumbi#8378
in other words: ownership counts for something, but not as much as in the original model

[18-Mar-19 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
you shifted the decimal place to the left two places, how does that prevent vote buying?

[18-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
```
I. notaries should have plenty of VOTE if they didn't dump the KMD earned over the previous year
II. sock puppets.
III. again, you shifted the decimal place, how does this prevent vote buying?
IV. eh, not a bad idea, but an added layer of complexity.
```

[18-Mar-19 10:23 AM] jorian#4555
💯 sums up my thoughts

[18-Mar-19 10:25 AM] jorian#4555
1.2 is enforced by the `-ac_public=1` parameter VOTE2019 will have

[18-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
to touch on IV again, I like the idea for multiple rounds to fill as many spots as possible with unique people, but this `Additionally, candidates  should be automatically disqualified if they share personal or family relations to elected notaries.  "Gifting" votes to third parties is forbidden and would likewise result in disqualification.` is entirely subjective and unenforceable

[18-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Alright#0419
we also shouldn't take away nodes from a competent OP for the sake of giving it to someone else

[18-Mar-19 10:30 AM] Alright#0419
@Lumbi these ideas are suggestions for 2020, right? 😛

[18-Mar-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
II. is totally ridiculous

[18-Mar-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
having 300,000 KMD worth of voting power for filling out a survey?

[18-Mar-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
please stop with nonsense

[18-Mar-19 10:44 AM] jorian#4555
voters decide with their votes who is an active member

[18-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Lumbi#8378
@Alright merely a proposal (for 2019). finally it is up to the community to decide what parts to keep and in what form. @jl777c I weighted active participation @ 3000 (not 300,000) ... the possibility of attracting crypto-minded ppl could be of incalculable value down the road (not just as promotional groupies, but techs as well).

[18-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Lumbi#8378
We could do chain-analysis of the Vote2019 chain and put a check on 'funny business' 😉

[18-Mar-19 11:02 AM] jorian#4555
` the possibility of attracting crypto-minded ppl could be of incalculable value down the road` if this is a reason for KNIP 0.0.1 then you should add it

👍 

[18-Mar-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
@Lumbi, you made it 1 vote per 100 KMD and active participation is 3000, so that is the equivalent of 300,000. yet you claim it is 3000. please stop with nonsense

[18-Mar-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
giving notaries equivalent of 500,000 is also extreme

[18-Mar-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i categorize your proposal as DOA

[18-Mar-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
math matters

[18-Mar-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant just pull random numbers out of the air and make it override KMD owners

[18-Mar-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
why should a sock puppet master that makes many accounts pass the survey get tens of millions of KMD voting.

[18-Mar-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
any also why should anybody be disqualified based on who they are related to?

[18-Mar-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if they can do a good job, why does it matter?

[18-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
In any case, any such massive changing of things would only make sense it things are massively broken. things are not massively broken

[18-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
taking away 99% of the power of KMD holders would require agreement from them, which creates quite a large barrier for any such silly proposals

[18-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
please stop with non math based proposals

[18-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
please stop with the "sock puppets are better than stake" arguments

[18-Mar-19 11:19 AM] Lumbi#8378
The numbers I came up with were sort of 'gut-based' so they are easy enough to increase or decrease as variables (including the KMD hodler = Vote2019 exchange rate). The provision against family/relations is to ensure impartiality (similar rules exist in corporations and gov).  Addition screening measures could be implemented to eliminate sockpuppetry.

[18-Mar-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
your gut based numbers are horribly wrong. anything other than 1:1 for KMD is likely wrong. notaries are not the govt, competency is all that matters and if your brother in law is also a notary, why should that prevent you from being one too? my rule is to disclose any existing relations and let the voters decide. Your claim that you can eliminate sockpuppetry is quite amazing to me. I am not technically capable enough to do this, yet you are able to? show me how

[18-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
also, any sock puppet prevention would need to work against someone hiring the captcha solving services that use manual labor from poor countries to fill them out manually

[18-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
your numbers are wrong
your gut is wrong

[18-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
you make impossible claims

[18-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
to fix a nonexistent problem

[18-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Lumbi#8378
@jl777c the sockpuppetry would have to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis on discord. It'd probably be more 'art' than 'science' -- but I could put together a KMD team to badger new recruits 😄

the more stringent the rules for candidates, the better the perceived credibility of dPoW.

[18-Mar-19 12:02 PM] mrlynch#5735
with a success rate of an optimistic 0.1%

[18-Mar-19 12:03 PM] mrlynch#5735
why rely on 'art' when science is needed?

[18-Mar-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@Lumbi please stop with the silly talk, it is a waste of time. without math based solutions, they wll just devolve to useless popularity contest. Also the premise that someone that has more KMD should not have more influence in the voting, this is an issue thatis not clear at all. why shouldnt someone with more KMD have more say about KMD notaries?

[18-Mar-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
please go to EOS and fix their voting problems, it is much much more of a problem that is actually a real one for them

[18-Mar-19 12:09 PM] Lumbi#8378
My sincere hope is that the voting public would look to the candidate's qualifications and/or past performance before making any decisions 🤞  ... art will always play some part in human-based election processes ....

[18-Mar-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the evaluation to use is if the slate of notaries is improving with each election. So far, it has without any doubts

[18-Mar-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
until we see stagnation of notary slate from year to year, then there is no problem to solve

[18-Mar-19 12:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
1:1 KMD:VOTE is as close as you can get to eliminating sock puppets

[18-Mar-19 01:00 PM] lukechilds#2707
There is an economic cost to buying KMD before the VOTE airdrop to inflate your voting power

[18-Mar-19 01:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
increasing VOTE's power by a factor of 100 and handing it out for free to Discord accounts has no economic cost and enables sock puppet masters to inflate their voting power

I actually have a ssh window opened with all the notarized transactions of the assetchains syncing and scrolling, and I randomly pick some transactions just to verify its does actually exist on kmdexplorer 😄

[18-Mar-19 06:06 PM] Strob#3417
@PHBA2061  I'm about to try to follow the installation instruction too, using bitcoin 16.3. So it's working for you even if there is no testnet? Are you really notarizing?

[18-Mar-19 06:57 PM] CHMEX#0686
It can't notarize unless elected last election.

[18-Mar-19 07:01 PM] PHBA2061#2530
@Strob  no, what I meant is if you follow the guide, at the "Import private key into assetchains" step, after running the ./assetchains commands, you'll see the list of notarized transactions in the past get synced

Seruiously, get that thing leanr how to use a mounse with it and be done with server managment. 
You make a layout save it with tmux ressurect and thats it. tbh I havent restarted my server in over 200 days at this point, but once you get everything loaded where you want it,. prints to panes, a network monitor and htop ... you just login and attach. Its pretty much like your notary has  GUI...
