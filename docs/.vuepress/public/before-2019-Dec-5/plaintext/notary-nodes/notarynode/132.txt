From just abandoned nodes to necromancy 😃

What are you planning on doing for abandoned nodes mid year?

[15-Apr-19 12:19 AM] Alright#0419
a handful of abandoned nodes is not much of a problem

[15-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
we have at least 2 right now

[15-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Alright#0419
solution is don't reelect them

4 nodes that haven't notarized in 2019

[15-Apr-19 12:21 AM] phm87#7395
4 nodes that haven't notarized KMD or any AC in 2019 ?

[15-Apr-19 12:21 AM] Alright#0419

oh thank you

[15-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
Who is running his node? No one wants to step up and say it's them

[15-Apr-19 12:24 AM] phm87#7395
but when a NN doesn't perform any notarization KMD->BTC, does it earn KMD or not ?

someone is still maintaining robe's node

It does, and having 64 is redundant. But it is critical for the security of the ecosystem.

[15-Apr-19 12:28 AM] Alright#0419
@phm87 the answer is yes, it's like a lame duck politician still getting a salary

[15-Apr-19 12:28 AM] phm87#7395
sigh ... I didn't know, I feel sad now

[15-Apr-19 12:28 AM] phm87#7395
thank you @Alright

[15-Apr-19 12:29 AM] Alright#0419
LABS will pay per notarization 😉

You're campaigning on having been a NN, stands to reason that your record (which is specifically relevant to that question) is relevant

We're both vying for the same job and you don't think it's proper for me to point out that you did poorly the last time you had that job?

[15-Apr-19 12:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
You ran 2 nodes that combined, literally, had less notarizations than some single nodes that only ran for 6 months

[15-Apr-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
And it's not right to point that out?

[15-Apr-19 12:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Or to refer to you/it when a question is asked that is a direct parallel?

I'm surprised to read that operators who failed to keep their node up to par because 'life happened' are still eligible for reelection.
That said, my own testnet node sucks and I cannot find any resources on improving performance, just that wallets should be kept small and network connectivity should be good.  I have those things yet still performing poorly compared to others.

@Greer are you managing UTXOs manually?

[15-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
did you disable auto split in iguana?

[15-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Alright#0419
that will kill your counts if you don't

[15-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Alright#0419

that's literally it

[15-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Greer#0666
ah, didn't know that.  I am not managing manually, wondered why people did that

[15-Apr-19 12:56 AM] Greer#0666
I've read the scripts that do it for you, seems quite simple but thought that was a thing of the past.  Will get on that then.

uncomment that, rebuild iguana, write/find some UTXO management scripts

http://cryptocartography.io/notarymap/ slightly updated. New candidates replaced old. Will add links to proposals etc later today. If you want to move location, give me the coordinates. If you have social medai links etc you want included, send me the link. If you want a dedicated NN operator `Vote DragonHound` 😄

Is there still an issue with splits not returning change to the wallet on BEER?

[15-Apr-19 04:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Or has this resolved itself in some way? I missed a few days of chat here it seems.

[15-Apr-19 04:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
All I know is iguan split works nice, and running split / selfsend / cleanwallettx too close together is a bad idea

[15-Apr-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[15-Apr-19 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think a-team does split evvery 15mins (if needed) and cleanwallettx rpc every 6H

[15-Apr-19 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sometimes it seems it may not clean due to utxo hanging around but its never goten into a bad state

[15-Apr-19 04:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got split at */15, selfsend at 55 */8 and run cleanwallet mannually

[15-Apr-19 04:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if things look funky, run unlock_utxo

[15-Apr-19 04:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`walletreset.sh` is our friend

[15-Apr-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there are many many ways to clean wallet.. I found a way that worked for me so I dont need to sepnd time tending to node, early on I psent nearly all day with it up on terminal just watching it...

[15-Apr-19 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now it almost the opposite... but right now seems places are locked in. I am using ti to test radical changes to uiguana to amke it more stable with very long run times.

is HP ProLiant DL360e Gen8 2x Eight 8-Core Xeon E5-2450L 64 gb ram 500gb ssd good enough for a notarynote for testnet?

[15-Apr-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
way too big for testnet

[15-Apr-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
$40 8GB VPS here

[15-Apr-19 05:47 AM] hastrup#8742
its just what i have at home, would it be good enough for a "real" notarynote

[15-Apr-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would just work with current requirements

[15-Apr-19 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but 128GB ram is better. Most  imporetant is I/O speed
