Painters plastic folded over then soldered together in the shape.   One open end to tape to a box or other type of fan

[26-Oct-18 07:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Spray painted and drew suction cups on them.

[26-Oct-18 07:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sounds like a lot but only took about 6 hours and I’ve had them for years.

@cryptographic you're free to offer any trade you like in #deleted-channel, but I really can't see anyone willing to sell to for less than it costs to mine it

I have  asked a question about onboarding issues in the "newpirates" channel. Would be thankful for answers...

[26-Oct-18 08:23 PM] yorktronic#2703
does the pirate chain really have 126.39 MSol/s (as of right now)? I ask because that's 72% of the Horizen / ZenCash nethash

@secparam @zooko Done, done, done and done.  
Even if people don’t know what they are doing, they can’t mess it up on Pirate.  

Too many “optional” coins that can’t compare with zec parameters used to their full potential, which is what we do.

yeah I'm just going off piratepool.io

[26-Oct-18 08:26 PM] yorktronic#2703
pretty crazy

[26-Oct-18 08:27 PM] crumb#2550
it's gonna get a lot crazier once we get a wider audience with all that stuff in motion

[26-Oct-18 08:27 PM] yorktronic#2703
it's 6.1% of the ZEC hashrate

[26-Oct-18 08:29 PM] yorktronic#2703
pretty rad -- I've never seen anything like it for a relatively under-the-radar coin

[26-Oct-18 08:30 PM] crumb#2550
if we take hashrate as a measure of value then ARRR should be valued $1.89 per token

[26-Oct-18 08:30 PM] crumb#2550
compared to ZEC

[26-Oct-18 08:31 PM] Flexatron#8809
Hehe

[26-Oct-18 08:32 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'm reading on the website that you can use Equihash or Verushash... is that true?

[26-Oct-18 08:32 PM] crumb#2550
only equihash

[26-Oct-18 08:32 PM] yorktronic#2703
okay that makes sense

[26-Oct-18 08:32 PM] yorktronic#2703
I was like... how is that possible

[26-Oct-18 08:33 PM] crumb#2550
where does it say verushash, if it's written it should be changed

[26-Oct-18 08:33 PM] crumb#2550
this should be corrected ASAP

is anybody working on that page? 2 weeks looks same as default WP theme ...

[26-Oct-18 08:35 PM] crumb#2550
better not to confuse people unnecessarily. i think the hash algo question has been asked before and james said there are no forseeable plans to change it from the current equihash

[26-Oct-18 08:57 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Give me a bottle of rum and I’d probably climb on the ship and go too far with the act

[26-Oct-18 08:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Need a blunderbuss to go with it

[26-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[26-Oct-18 09:01 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

:realpirate: Pirates, Hear ye, hear ye! :realpirate: 

I am collaborating an internal list of dev and contributors to the project.  I have many of you already added but if you could find time over the next few days to DM me your role, and if you don't wish to divulge, at least let me know, and I will keep it labelled anonymous.   
I'd rather have a list of 3 real devs and 10 anons than 3 reals, 1 anon and noone else that we know of 😛

[26-Oct-18 09:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So far my list is about 10 pirates long.    
Translators, I have you already listed, same for Pool ops.

[26-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Flexatron#8809
The website should have a table with pools and rank them on payout frequency, min. payout, fee rate

[26-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Flexatron#8809

[26-Oct-18 09:38 PM] Steve10#5203
I'm a little confused about the contest that is running. I did all the steps but the last one, what tweet needs to be retweeted and posted? Is it a specific one or every tweet posted?

[26-Oct-18 09:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Usually a specific one each day

[26-Oct-18 09:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Check pirate marketing for the most recent.

[26-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Steve10#5203
Ok. So do I get credit for retweeting the past few days or just for the current day?

[26-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Steve10#5203
I'm excited about this project so I'll retweeted them all but just wondering.

[26-Oct-18 09:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
All credit is being tracked and you will recevie pirate at the end of the comp.

[26-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Steve10#5203
Cool. Now I'm trying to figure out how to get the link to my retweet so I can post it. On a phone and I'm not sure how to get it lol

[26-Oct-18 09:52 PM] yorktronic#2703
you can already see pool info on https://miningpoolstats.stream/pirate but it doesn't have payout information

[26-Oct-18 09:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The website has been updated to show all the mining pools @yorktronic

[26-Oct-18 09:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Screenshots work too

[26-Oct-18 10:03 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
When I do that it copies your official tweet

Ahh

[26-Oct-18 10:05 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
I was going to do that but then it doesn’t show I retweeted on ur actual post “weird”which is why I went  the route I did

[26-Oct-18 10:07 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
I retweet everything anyway 😂

[26-Oct-18 10:13 PM] Steve10#5203
@DR3WSKi thanks. I was having the problem of only getting the link to the official tweet, not my retweet too. I figured out that I have to retweet with comment so now I'm redoing my retweets with comments lol.

[26-Oct-18 10:14 PM] Steve10#5203
I'll screenshot and post everything. Do we just have to dm our address once or for each retweet?

[26-Oct-18 10:15 PM] DR3WSKi#8767
Once should be sufficient as they will give payouts after it is all done

@rckr ARRR is the ticker for Pirate. Pirate is a forced anonymous transaction blockchain. It is a Komodo Assetchain that is secured by dPoW & uses zksnarks for anonymous transactions. It is regarded as the most private crypto currency on the market.
