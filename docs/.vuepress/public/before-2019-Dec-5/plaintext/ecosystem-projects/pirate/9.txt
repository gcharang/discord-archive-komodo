CC relies on OP_RETURN data that is public

[01-Sep-18 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
zaddr metadata is private, can't be verified by others, i.e. the rest of the network doesn't know what the contract is, etc...

[01-Sep-18 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
*but* I believe we have solved the notarization issue

[01-Sep-18 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
the new rule for `ac_private=1` should be "Only coinbase *or* amount=0 transparent outputs are allowed"

[01-Sep-18 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
my patch above does that, trying to verify it actually works correctly

[01-Sep-18 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
what this means, is that you must use z_sendmany

[01-Sep-18 06:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
you can't do a taddr -> taddr amount=0 xtn, that is still illegal

[01-Sep-18 06:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
that leaks too much metadata

[01-Sep-18 06:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
so first, the person must move to a zaddr, then if that person, a NN, wants to notarize, they can make an amount=0 xtn

[01-Sep-18 06:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
via z_sendmany

[01-Sep-18 06:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder i think this opens the door for a 2 stage kind of approach to making stuff work

[01-Sep-18 06:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Interesting

[01-Sep-18 06:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
like, we store a bit of info in OP_RETURN, but other stuff in private zaddr metadata (which there is a lot more of, per xtn)

[01-Sep-18 06:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
that would be a James question

[01-Sep-18 06:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thanks for doing what u doing mate :-)

[01-Sep-18 06:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's just fun, I guess

[01-Sep-18 06:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If both notarization and CC solves for private chain I would like to turn MESH to private only.

[01-Sep-18 06:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
CC for ac_private means implement new contracts from the ground up, new internals, but perhaps they can build on the ones we have. Extensions that can unlock rewards to zaddrs and stuff like that

[01-Sep-18 06:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes OK with new cc contracts. I wish to have private only chains to be CC capable

[01-Sep-18 06:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
i agree, that would be very interesting

[01-Sep-18 06:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
when Sapling turns on in Zcash 2.x, we will see real benchmarks of how much faster shielding has gotten

[01-Sep-18 06:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
True, and recreating the existing cc on private only chain would be I guess a on field exercise like for a new dev like me

[01-Sep-18 06:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
i wouldn't call it trivial 😃

[01-Sep-18 06:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
but at least you have a well-worn path to follow from James's 4 initial contracts

[01-Sep-18 06:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yea... At least I have good help here... from the ground up...

[01-Sep-18 06:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
just did my first PIRATE z_shieldcoinbase

[01-Sep-18 06:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe that wasn't a good idea since the chain is stuck

[01-Sep-18 06:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Haha

[01-Sep-18 06:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah buddy

the infamous memo field, 512 bytes of joy

😄 

[01-Sep-18 06:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am thinking of CC contracts where basic info is stored publicy in OP_RETURN, the very atoms of how the contract works, but the actual "meat" of the contract, which addresses get paid, how much, etc... are stored in the memo field, encrypted, viewable only to those that have the private key to the address that received that memo

[01-Sep-18 06:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
viewing keys probably could be used to help implement CC with some data in zaddr memo fields

it's just brutally slow with Sprout, hopefully Sapling makes stuff reasonable. Not even fast, just reasonable

[01-Sep-18 06:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
I embedded a 27KB image of the Hush logo into the Hush blockchain, in one transaction (54 addrs x 512 bytes) and it took *45 minutes* to make the transaction, before getting sent to the network

[01-Sep-18 06:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
even just 45 seconds of pegging a CPU, to send to one output, is kind of shitty

[01-Sep-18 06:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
Sapling has 2way viewing keys, they changed everything, I think for the better. But also it's a bit more complex

[01-Sep-18 06:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
2way viewing keys probably open up the door for atomic swaps and CC's that have some data hidden

[01-Sep-18 06:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
if the algorithm of your smart contract is public, but the addresses that it pays out to are not, isn't that pretty good ? I think it solves the use case most people are after

I think it was me who started all that... I was drunk and thaught it would be a good idea to mine all the PIRATE

Is pirate destined for digitalprice.io ?

[01-Sep-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not too sure with the chain as it currently is I dont think anything apart from OTC trades are possible.

[01-Sep-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it would take a lot of computing power to have digitalprice.io run a z-tx only node.

[01-Sep-18 06:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, they want to charge $200 every time they need to upgrade your coin

[01-Sep-18 06:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't make financial sense for an exchange to do shielded xtns, and it might not even be technically feasible for the load of transactions they need to break even

[01-Sep-18 06:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe if they charged large fees, but that just drives users to use transparent addresses it seems

[01-Sep-18 06:53 AM] Don King#8901
afaik the only other coin that is as anon as pirate would be byteballs sister coin, blackbytes  , there would be a market for this, agree, any exchange would have to charge large fees

[01-Sep-18 06:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
blackbytes, eh?

[01-Sep-18 06:55 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, byteballs airdrop included a second coin blackbytes that is completely  opaque as well

[01-Sep-18 07:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think this points out an explorer bug (sorry if I sound like a broken record) where it doesn't even show the output correctly

[01-Sep-18 07:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
I guess pure transparent outputs have their address rendered, but transparent outputs of joinsplits are different

[01-Sep-18 07:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not sure if notarization code can use these kinds of outputs, @jl777c will have to weigh in, if this will allow notarizing PIRATE

James will have to weigh in on whether that will help us notarize

[01-Sep-18 07:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
a transparent output from a JoinSplit isn't quite *exactly* the same as a pure taddr -> taddr output, which has OP_RETURN data. If it is, then we are very lucky, my guess is that it's not

[01-Sep-18 07:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
so we might have to modify how notarization works a bit. But it no longer seems impossible, so that is good

[01-Sep-18 07:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
this was all sparked by @Alright's trick to use CC rpcs to make a transparent output, nice sneaky trick ye salty dog

[01-Sep-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
notarization is a multisig transaction

[01-Sep-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
I did that right after the `faucetadd 0`. It's a completely normal t -> t

[01-Sep-18 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c the notaries just need to split funds while mining blocks

[01-Sep-18 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
anyone want to trade their STAKED for PIRATE before the snapshot happens in an hour?

[01-Sep-18 02:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright maybe I am confused, but I thought the entire point of ac_private was to prevent transparent outputs?

[01-Sep-18 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
well currently the check is if nValue > 0 for t -> t txs

[01-Sep-18 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
or something like that, would need to look

[01-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
but if outputs of a tx are 0 t -> t works fine

[01-Sep-18 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
you can do round about t -> t s using that

[01-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
similar to how I sent 1000 PIRATE to the burn address

[01-Sep-18 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright which rpc are you using?

[01-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
so it's more like default to privacy but you can opt out if you really really have to

[01-Sep-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
and opting out isn't easy

[01-Sep-18 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
