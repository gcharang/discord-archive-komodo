[telegram] <Ggokhangark> If it is not now then it will go to 0,0001100 -1120 (re @torsten1: There will be a pullback at some point obviously)

[09-Nov-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Abhittttt> Yes. Binance has bigger  influence in crypto space.. so pump is started from Binance (re @Regnar: The individual trades on those closed off exchanges will have greater impact on the price because they won't be getting checked by arbitrage)

[09-Nov-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> I think the pump could have started from anywhere realistically. As long as it had decent volume and wasn't so big of a price difference that CMC, coinpaprika, and coingecko algorithms excluded that exchanges prices for being outliers

[09-Nov-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> A mix of increasing social media presence and support, cool tech developments, and probably the fact that deposits are disabled on Binance which makes prices more volatile
