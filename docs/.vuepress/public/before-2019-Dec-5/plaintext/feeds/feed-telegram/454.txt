[telegram] <Regnar> So these channels are all community run actually. Many of the Admins are also on the team or moderators, but the telegram channels are all community run. So if you wanted to lead the Turkish channel you are welcome to start it! I think we would need more admins who could speak the language to be helpful though, this is a 24 hour thing so it's nice to be geographically separated. (re @Ggokhangark: Regnar 👆👆)
