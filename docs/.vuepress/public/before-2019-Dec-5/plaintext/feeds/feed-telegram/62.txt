[telegram] <Patricia> NEO在2018年3月1日开启ONT本体空投（一个邮箱送1000ONT，上市后价格最高60多元，白捡6万元），如今同样的套路再来一遍。
由丹华资本、NEO、ONT力荐的DAD，开始了第一轮1000万DAD空投，仅需邮箱即可获得代币，错过ONT，别再错过DAD！http://t.cn/RgpRWy9
On March 1st, 2018, NEO launched ONT airdrop (one mailbox sent 1000ONT, the price after the listing was more than $10, you got 10 thousand US dollars for free), and now it happens again.
DAD which is recommended by Danhua Capital, NEO and ONT started the first round of 10 million DAD airdrops. You only need the mailbox to get tokens. You may miss ONT, but don't miss DAD again. http://t.cn/RgpRWy9
