[19-Apr-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
It's added 1 satoshi

[19-Apr-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
So `positionsize` is `intialbetsize`, `equity` is `initialbetsize` + `addedbets`

[19-Apr-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
+ profit

[19-Apr-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe rename`positionsize` to `initialbetsize` ? It's quite confusing

[19-Apr-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
well the initial bet is the size of the position

[19-Apr-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
But there is added funding

[19-Apr-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be that we cant allow funds to be added and maintain risk management

[19-Apr-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Which actually enlarging your position

[19-Apr-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
no

[19-Apr-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the definition i am using is the position is what the leverage applies to

[19-Apr-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise if you have a 50% loss and addfunding 50% is lost immediate

[19-Apr-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there is a possible attack...

[19-Apr-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so ` "addedbets"` should be `addedmargin` maybe

[19-Apr-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
make a small bet at 777 leverage

[19-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
as it goes negative add enough margin to prevent being rekt

[19-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if on average you add less than 777x small bet size, you end up ahead

[19-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so i think the rekt percentage should change based on leverage

[19-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
at no leverage you are not rekt till negative

[19-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
at high leverage you are rekt at something higher, like 30%?

[19-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure need some modeling on this

[19-Apr-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Bitmex connecting margin to rektprice - when you adding more margin to position your rektprice moving

[19-Apr-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
quite clearly for trader in such case

[19-Apr-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
You can also take back some (or all) added margin if your position stands good

[19-Apr-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
So for now: 
```costbasis print is wrong
rekt price showing as 0
profits showing as 0
priceaddfunding add funding in satoshis```
@dimxy

[19-Apr-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, lets change it to work more like bitmex

[19-Apr-19 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe I just not understood current clue so far with costbasis

[19-Apr-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the big issue is that we use the 24hour average

[19-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that means if the mined price is significantly above the smoothed price, a price rise for the next 24hrs is already baked in

[19-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it cant help but go up

[19-Apr-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so we cant let bettors use future knowledge. any such future knowledge, leveraged and bankroll is gone

[19-Apr-19 11:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Attacks vectors on oracle stops us to use realtime price?

[19-Apr-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the chain will stop if the oracle is someone stopped

[19-Apr-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, we cant use the mined price due to the 2% attack

[19-Apr-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
miner would just need to bias price 1% higher, place a bet, then bias -1%, to get a 2% swing, which under leverage is enormous

[19-Apr-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so we do the prior 24hr 51% correlation using a deterministic random. that means a miner can bias it +/-1% but wont know which block (if any) it will be used in and much less likely if it is a biased price

[19-Apr-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so we get the correlated price, but that is literally a random price from the prior day that just happened to be correlated with a majority of prices

[19-Apr-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
https://www.bitmex.com/app/index/.BXBT maybe use such index - so to move price 1% you have to move it on all exchanges

[19-Apr-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is not useful for trading due to this choppiness

[19-Apr-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but the miner can submit a +/-1% price

[19-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter the source

[19-Apr-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, submit into oracle

[19-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so the average of the prior 24hrs is the trustless price feed

[19-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but this has 24hrs of future knowledge that hasnt been incorporated yet

[19-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so....

[19-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the cost basis needs to be based on the max value of the pricefeed for 24hrs

[19-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so that is the thinking behind the costbasis changing during the first 24hrs

[19-Apr-19 11:48 AM] dimxy#2587
Now profits is 0 as costbasis=lastprice

[19-Apr-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt always be the last price

[19-Apr-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
only if lastprice is the MAX

[19-Apr-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise there would be a loss

[19-Apr-19 11:57 AM] dimxy#2587
Firstheight block was skipped for calc
Maybe for the blocks after , the lastprice is max indeed

[19-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c we cannot set ac_supply to 0 as we need initial funds to setup gateway and fund oracle publishers. So what should be the limit?

[19-Apr-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the magic calculation will provide some coins

[19-Apr-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
around 10

[19-Apr-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
even with supply of 0

[19-Apr-19 05:38 PM] Alright#0419
Could someone give me steps for properly building daemon for prices? I did the same process I was using for dilithium, and `cclibinfo` still shows me rogue rpcs

[19-Apr-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
prices CC is built in

[19-Apr-19 05:40 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt use libcc

[19-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
`-ac_cclib=prices` threw me off

[19-Apr-19 05:43 PM] Alright#0419
Are the rpcs mentioned in comments in prices.cpp not implemented yet?

[19-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
`pricesbet` or `pricesaddfunding` for example

[19-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
method not found

[19-Apr-19 05:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is in dimxy repo

[19-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
Ahhh ok was trying FSM

[19-Apr-19 05:44 PM] Alright#0419
your FSM that is

[19-Apr-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
bug fixed versiom with rpc not merged yet

[19-Apr-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
I see he's working on it right now

[19-Apr-19 05:45 PM] Alright#0419
his prices-rpc branch

[19-Apr-19 05:46 PM] Alright#0419
@dimxy sorry to bother, but could you ping me when I can test that?

[19-Apr-19 05:57 PM] dimxy#2587
I just pushed corrections for pricesinfo (costbasis calculations)

https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/makeprices#L2
does this file exist because `prices` was going to be dynamic before, but now it has been made core ?

[19-Apr-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
good!

[19-Apr-19 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so now there should be a loss if ever the price is lower

[19-Apr-19 08:19 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it should be a profit now because it's long and last price (and costbasis) is > than firstprice

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
no the costbasis is what you paid for

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
remember the "cant use future info" rule

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so the price you paid for it wont be known for 24 hours

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if you paid the same price as it is now, 0 profits

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so game will actually start in 24hours

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for the first 24hrs the best you can do is breakeven

[19-Apr-19 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
you can get rekt within 24 hours like you suggested, when that is implemented

[19-Apr-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is the game of how much will you put into the position before the 24hrs

[19-Apr-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Finally almost collected  in head puzzle how it works

[19-Apr-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Will price from which I start be fixed automatically in 24 hours?

[19-Apr-19 08:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, after 24 hours there is the costbasis that is permanent

[19-Apr-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can make a strategy that wins more than random chance, that is a bug

[19-Apr-19 08:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, some "blocks_until_costbasis_fixed" timer might be very helpful imo

[19-Apr-19 08:23 PM] TonyL#3577
`if you can make a strategy that wins more than random chance, that is a bug` - have to make timemachine for it I think

[19-Apr-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
then we are good and it is a matter to tune the monetization, rekt percentages, limits on addingfunds?

[19-Apr-19 08:24 PM] jl777c#5810
stuff like that

[19-Apr-19 08:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So for now I have to open few positions and wait 24 hours to see what will happen.

Maybe we can make some "temporary testing" version in which lock will happen in a few minutes to not wait 1 day to test rekt/profit claim cases?
