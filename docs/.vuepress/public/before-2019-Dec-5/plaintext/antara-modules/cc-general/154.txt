fits in with the text nature and then let somebody else convert it into graphics

[02-Feb-19 08:48 PM] TonyL#3577
For mechanics maturing/testing TUI should be enough

[02-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
agreed. let us aim for that

[02-Feb-19 08:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sure somebody with the graphics experience will want to help out on that side of things, it is quite cool to have a blockchained rpg

[02-Feb-19 08:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess there is one on ETH already, but not sure how good it is

[02-Feb-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm it have gameplay based on chain or only payments?

[02-Feb-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
and who wants to burn ETH to play a game?

[02-Feb-19 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure of any details. i heard of some space adventure game

[02-Feb-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Game which I saw  have only token payments of ingame items

[02-Feb-19 08:52 PM] TonyL#3577
So Sudoku -> in a few days Rogue: You can come to GTA6 on blockchain with such progress 😂

[02-Feb-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
all that is needed is game engine that is deterministic random

[02-Feb-19 08:53 PM] SHossain#0007
i want Need For Speed

[02-Feb-19 08:53 PM] jl777c#5810
ROGUE is a demonstration of how to blockchain such a game

[02-Feb-19 08:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it will take a full week to do it though, much more work than SUDOKU

A nes Zelda style rpg with treasure chests in the game that have KMD....would change the world :

[02-Feb-19 08:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be much easier than ROGUE, at least if it is a text adventure game. but it would be english only...

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] SHossain#0007
would racing game be possible?

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] SHossain#0007
upgrades, trading cars, car parts

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] SHossain#0007

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] jl777c#5810
given a deterministic game engine, ANY such game can be blockchained

[02-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Haha we made such GUI for etherem with opensource crew I worked before

[02-Feb-19 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is that given a 64bit seed and the same user events, identical state is achieved

[02-Feb-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Racing on spaceships

[02-Feb-19 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
someone needs to contact EA

[02-Feb-19 09:00 PM] SHossain#0007
or Gameloft

[02-Feb-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i just liked rogue as it doesnt have a clock, has ingame items and doesnt need graphics

[02-Feb-19 09:01 PM] jl777c#5810
plus it seems to be quite rich in gameplay

[02-Feb-19 09:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so long durations of gameplay fits in an opreturn

[02-Feb-19 09:02 PM] SHossain#0007
that's a nice idea to start with rogue

[02-Feb-19 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, just another demonstration of what can be done with CC

Imo terminal rogue game is infinity times more interesting to play that any "collectable" game like a cryptokitties even if this "collectable" game will have best graphics in the universe

[02-Feb-19 09:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Because it have a gameplay! 😃

is it possible to have a cc-fair-ico that will allow to 1. auto send back collected KMD when soft cap not reached 2. pay collected KMD in installments after voting 3. when projects failed after some installments - people voted to kill it - send back the remaining KMD ?

[03-Feb-19 07:38 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I think fair-ico machine would be great for fair projects in ecosystem, might also get some attention from media maybe

[03-Feb-19 07:39 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
this coule be really a product ready to use as ico's run every day almost - since product ready to use might be advertised more then any other

Re the game company, I can talk to the lead designer from H1Z1, I just need a clear brief

to make a graphics display that is driven by original rogue game events (text only)

[03-Feb-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 certainly such a ico CC  can be done, but it seems there is not much demand for it. CC are turing complete ->anything that can have some program written for it can be done in a CC

[03-Feb-19 12:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I understand there is "no demand" but I believe it is simmilar "no demand" as denamnd for cars before car era - people do not know they like to have sth before it comes into existance (horses where perfect transportation for many - why some strange engine?). Once investors understand it's sth that can be there and work for securing their funds - they will expect everyone use that.

[03-Feb-19 12:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
fair ico cc or maybe better - fair startup cc

[03-Feb-19 12:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it funding any startup is more general then just ico

[03-Feb-19 12:40 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Is there a progress table for cc with work time estimation? Even if the idea do not suit current time - good to keep all cc ideas in some table with progress and rough work time estimation,. Community will grow into more devs, some things can be realised later.

[05-Feb-19 05:31 AM] Hermes#6934
Thats a good idea indeed

[06-Feb-19 12:01 PM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL @jl777c TUI is the best yes plz.  All we need to show is the logic flow / workflow for existing CC.  When ppl can see flow with the CC code, it will have bigger effect

the idea isnt for us (me) to do all possible games. I am making a proof of concept of how to blockchain a deterministic random game. once that is out there, the hope is many game devs decide to launch a chain of their own

[08-Feb-19 12:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c does these game chains require dPoW? (of course dPoW adds additional layer of security for any chain)

[08-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
before it becomes something people can trade safely on exchanges, it would need dPoW, but just for protecting ingame gold conversions to ROGUE, it seems dPoW is overkill. even if your tx is reorged, you can just issue another one

[08-Feb-19 12:15 PM] SHossain#0007
Thanks for your answer.

I have a question, is the Crypto Condition Smart contract running on a side chain in Komodo Platform?

So `Asset Chains` are just really `Komodo` side chains @gcharang ?

[11-Feb-19 08:51 AM] jorian#4555
asset chains are completely independent blockchains

[11-Feb-19 08:52 AM] jorian#4555
i'll let the master speak

[11-Feb-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
side chain has special meaning, we are making those too, but assetchains are independent and have no direct linkage to KMD.

[11-Feb-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of them notarize to KMD, but that is an independent choice

[11-Feb-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
most of them are runtime forks

[11-Feb-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
no source level changes

[11-Feb-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
though you can do that too, as VRSC has done

[11-Feb-19 09:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c thanks, so `Asset Chains` are independent blockchains,  but `Crypto Condition` smart contract runs on-chain and broadcast them to the whole `Asset chain` in the KMD ecosystem?

[11-Feb-19 09:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
For source level changes, what if we change the `signature scheme and PoW algorithm'? Is that still doable with Asset chains?

[11-Feb-19 09:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes.. PoW algo can be changed like VRSC did, we use a modified VeruHash in #kmdlabs

[11-Feb-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
CC for a specific chain is only broadcast to nodes for that specific chain

[11-Feb-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
CC are turing complete, if you can code it, you can put it into a CC. though probably some things dont belong in a CC. certainly a new signature scheme is a perfect fit

[11-Feb-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
you can implement schnorr signatures, or shamirs secret, or whatever fancy new crypto signing method

[11-Feb-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
each new CC is a new dedicated transaction type that must follow all the existing rules and whatever new rules you add

[11-Feb-19 09:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks @jl777c and @blackjok3r , so I have read in the developer docs that the `Asset Chain` has a choice to leave the KMD ecosystem, but once it leaves the ecosystem, is it able to create its own Asset Chain and CC?

[11-Feb-19 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[11-Feb-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it is open source, if you want you can fork it and maintain a new project

[11-Feb-19 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Your just working with KMD code base at athat point. With #kmdlabs  we have added quite a large amount of features... but can still load and run/mign all komodo chains

[11-Feb-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what "leave the KMD ecosystem" means specifically...

[11-Feb-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I assume that would mean changing so much copde that it no l;onger ran otehr KMD assetchains...

[11-Feb-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if it means you wont talk to any of us here, i guess that is possible

{Reactions}
🤣 

[11-Feb-19 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or even KMD itself

[11-Feb-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so source level changes that breaks compatibility. certainly that is possible, but we hope that useful additions are merged back into the mainchain, like VRSC does

[11-Feb-19 09:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c  and @blackjok3r forking the project might be use a lot of time rather than creating an `Asset Chain`.

Maybe I have wrong understanding on `Move elsewhere` 😦

[11-Feb-19 09:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
assetchain params are very powerful, unless you wanted something very specific using them is usally enough withoug changing code. Small addition can be made by KMD ourself, which has happened in the past.

[11-Feb-19 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
@blackjok3r so creating a `Asset Chain` *sample-coin* and changing the PoW and signature scheme perhaps both needs changes on C++ core level and CC?

[11-Feb-19 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
changint he PoW isnt trivial ... I know how to add one kind of... but its not like a plug an play option YET... if its highly demanded then its something we can add, but its a lot of work to do it properly.

There is no connection between diffrent assetchains, unless they explicitly want it. See: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#summary-of-ac-cc
