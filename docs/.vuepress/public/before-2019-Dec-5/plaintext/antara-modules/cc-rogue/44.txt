Is it possible to allow in game items to also be tradeable via Dex in addition to whole characters? It seems this would add a delightful experience. -Asking for a friend...

[18-Feb-19 08:00 PM] joe2x4#5987
Is it probable?

[18-Feb-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
i believe this is possible and you may see it in the future

There are this o_group property checks in pack.c but can't collect puzzle pieces together so far

[18-Feb-19 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Interesting that on pickup there is no any check if it group https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rogue/pack.c#L229
But on leave pack it's checking if obj->o_group
In original rogue such groups counted as 1

Will try to remove this o_group argument at all - maybe it's a clue
 Interesting how things will behave 😃

What I've detected so far (without code modifications) is that it counting initial arrows as one object when drop it and pick up
Playing by ./rogue 777 gui
When pickup food with initial pack:
```                           |...%@. strength*3 48 vs total.42 vs 5 inventory let
                           +...... a) 2 rations of food
                           ------- b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
                                   c) A +1,+1 mace (weapon in hand)
                                   d) A +1,+0 short bow
                                   e) 38 +0,+0 arrows
                                   --Press space to continue--```

[18-Feb-19 09:30 PM] TonyL#3577
When then drop and pickup pack with arrows it's counting as 1:
```                                   strength*3 48 vs total.5 vs 4 inventory lett
                                   a) 2 rations of food
                           ------- b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
                           |...... c) A +1,+1 mace (weapon in hand)
                           |...%.. d) A +1,+0 short bow
                           +...... e) 38 +0,+0 arrows
                           ------- --Press space to continue--```

But if shot one arrow, drop pack and pickup pack counting not as 1 items but as total arrows amount

[18-Feb-19 09:34 PM] TonyL#3577
So on pick up  arrows not recounting. There are really tricky state changes conditions on drop/pick-up packed throwable stuff. Mindblowing - easier just count these throwable items packs as 1 item imo and not even try to count/recount on pickup - just count any pickup as +1 item 😂

i dont want to mess with the code unless to fix a serious issue. as you see it is very tricky and intricate

is it good to compile on mac or still issues?

[19-Feb-19 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
No need to makerogue if you're using rogue_multiOS, build/build-mac should makerogue automatically. Just build and try to sync then

[19-Feb-19 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Feb-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c true, in the end I just tried to understand why counters in max inventory limit count 1 more (it allows to take x3*strength + item) - seems it's connected to original game hardcoded rule that you can't have less than 1 item in inventory (it have validation if you'll try to drop last one). Was just interesting research - realised that can read C code if just imagine -> as . and {} as 4 spaces idents 😂

[19-Feb-19 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Proceeding to multiplayer

[19-Feb-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
I changed it so ISMANY objects count as 1

[19-Feb-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but the maxtotal is 2x strength

[19-Feb-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
whitespace having effect on code is quite crazy

[19-Feb-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
violates some basic rules about being unambiguous, eg. is 4 spaces the same as tab

[19-Feb-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
But in python miss one space is quite same as forget { in C :)
Oh cool, ISMANY as 1  - it should eliminate this headache

[19-Feb-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks god IDE converting tab to 4 spaces - one time I've edited python code in nano - pressed tab instead of 4 spaces and then troubleshooted for a while

[19-Feb-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just wrong to be able to look at the code and not know for sure what it says due to any ambiguity,let alone invisible things like spaces, tabs

[19-Feb-19 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
https://bugs.python.org/issue22086 people even opening issues because of such problems lol

[19-Feb-19 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Cool, ISMANY as 1 working as a charm, even when I shot one arrow and dropped pack and picked up it's counting as 1
Player can just imagine that it's a magic quiver. Like a when you have ammo pack - in games it's usually just pack, not depends how many ammo you have

[19-Feb-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can take up many inventory spots, but just one maxstrength spot

Hmm in which transaction player which broadcasted highlander should receive pot?

[19-Feb-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
I can see output only to loosing player (loosing player wallet R9vESme6P1rqVNFVBidtViGevZ3SJ7KVia)

Buyin in this game was 0.1

[19-Feb-19 09:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh no, it's winner wallet

[19-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
how much gold did you have?

[19-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that plus both buyins it should be

[19-Feb-19 09:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Not remember but less than 100

[19-Feb-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and multiplayer games pay double rate for gold

[19-Feb-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
I've quit on level2

[19-Feb-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
highlander 10x

[19-Feb-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
0.01 ROGUE per gold

[19-Feb-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for the highlander

[19-Feb-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
0.87 payout -> 0.67 in gold, could you have had 67 gold?

[19-Feb-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see so if it was 70 gold - player received 0,7 + 0,2 buyins

[19-Feb-19 09:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Looks like a true, next game will track gold balance

[19-Feb-19 09:08 AM] TonyL#3577
So if highlander in multiplayer with 5000 gold it's  50 ROGUE coins - cool!

[19-Feb-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i can see a lot more multiplayer games in the future

[19-Feb-19 09:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But aren't players can't cheat this way? Just  play against each other with buyin 0.01 to grind gold and cashout

[19-Feb-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is the 5 block wait

[19-Feb-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and the strict time limit

[19-Feb-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it devalues ROGUE by 10x, but as it was likely few are selling ROGUE as it is so hard to get

[19-Feb-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, some devalue was the point

[19-Feb-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the more ROGUE circulating, the more people will pay for playerdata

[19-Feb-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it shouldnt be 10x for a last man standing...

[19-Feb-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but only if you have amulet

{Reactions}
💯 

[19-Feb-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will change to 2x if lastman standing

[19-Feb-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Abusing prevention

[19-Feb-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so 4x single player

[19-Feb-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
still worth doing, but with 5 block wait time maybe not that much benefit as you can almost get killed in 5 blocks

[19-Feb-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
If you're so cool to find amulet you earn a lot of gold

[19-Feb-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
And it's stimulating playerdata market even more

[19-Feb-19 09:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Since players will want not only defeat opponent to take the buyin but also find the amulet

[19-Feb-19 09:13 AM] TonyL#3577
So will need strong enough warriors

so now it is 2x for multiplayer, 4x for last man standing, 20x for amulet win (over single player farming)

{Reactions}
treasure 

[19-Feb-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it encourages multiplayer (real or no) with the 2x. at least there is a chance some random roguer will join and play against you

[19-Feb-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also when you win, your pack items are converted to gold and I think it is many thousands of gold

[19-Feb-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Stimulating to move into multiplayer 👍

[19-Feb-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
After you trained in singleplayer

[19-Feb-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
still the total won even with amulet should be less than 100 ROGUE

[19-Feb-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and considering some player play for years and never win, it seems the value per ROGUE cant be very low

[19-Feb-19 09:26 AM] ph03nix#3115
what is max supply of ROGUE

[19-Feb-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
infinite

[19-Feb-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
10% of all transactions goes into the main CC address, which pays out the gold -> ROGUE

[19-Feb-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so the more games played, the more funds available

[19-Feb-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
"CCbalance": 1202386.13391190,

[19-Feb-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
I estimate about 20,000 free trading ROGUE exists at this moment

[19-Feb-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
a better store of value in ROGUE would be a high quality playerdata

[19-Feb-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but the inflation rate of ROGUE is designed to scale with usage, and the more usage, the more it is worth. Not sure if the -ac_perc 10% is the exact right value

[19-Feb-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but pretty sure it is within an order of magnitude

[19-Feb-19 09:34 AM] ph03nix#3115
so the main CC address will never run out of funds?

[19-Feb-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it might temporarily run out of funds. in that case, you would need to wait with your bailout/highlander tx, but it is self-replenishing based on usage
