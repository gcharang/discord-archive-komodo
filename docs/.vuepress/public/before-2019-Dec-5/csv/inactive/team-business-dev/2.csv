With all the equihash power of ASIC and GPU in the community, renting Sol/h and Gb to developers in a descentralizad manner seems pretty interesting and will make the new blockchains much more cheap to deploy and scale initially, at least until the coin gets enough value to attract miners. If the blockchain gains traction Komodo gains by retaining some of the coins, if not, the solution may still be useful and applied for the final users and will get some FIAT besides dPOW and Trading. In essence all you need to implement this is a balancer structure that redirects miners to different Blockchains accordingly, and the automated payments of course.";"";"";

Example: if all equihash coins make a hardfork to protect from current ASIC there will be Th/s of ASIC available for komodo,  this could make the external dPOW less necessary and save a lot money in BTC attracting more developers, miners and even other blockchains (as the dPOW would be much more cheap and faster) also it will inject more FIAT as mining (or Holding) wouldn't  be the best option to pay for the dPOW in a competitive scenario like that, also hash power could be rented to protect small chains between dPOWs (injecting even more FIAT from developers, startups and organizations), 10 minutes its a small lapse of time to hit komodo, but its enough to ruin most dAPPs, ICOs or Smart Contracts logics and structure.
