- replace `$k` in `$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKey($k)` (line 141) with your private key in hex format https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/genkomodo.php#L141
- ofc you'll need to convert your compressed WIF to the private key, here's how:
convert your WIF from base58 to hex, using a tool like this (offline of course) http://lenschulwitz.com/base58
once you obtain your WIF in  hex format , for example :
```BC10A4928997C1A45BE602806F3DA292206F66EB4BFD36FBE431EB0DBFE4CC414C01168A5381```
remove the first 2 characters (BC = 188 in hex which is the wif type of KMD) & the last 10 characters (`01`-this is the compression byte and `168A5381` - this is the first 4 bytes of the double SHA256 checksum of all the previous bytes). Then you'll have:
```10A4928997C1A45BE602806F3DA292206F66EB4BFD36FBE431EB0DBFE4CC414C```
This is the private key that you'll need to insert in the first step";"";"";
