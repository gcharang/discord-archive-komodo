All of the CryptoConditions stuff was generating a lot of buzz and there was that dungeon game.... then k64 entered the scene and for me at least sort of gave the impression it was the next iteration of “blockchain enforced” gaming, but of course that’s a mess at the moment. When we see a game or something highly interactive on the blockchain, like some sort of game (maybe even the duneon one, but with a web interface, with the same ease of use as AtomicDex, I’d imagine Kmd  will get a lot of attention.";"";"";

Key points id reiterate - no KYC required, supports Eth, erc-20, most bitcoin protocol coins etc. Kadan knows this of course and I’ve heard him articulate this clearly before, but sometimes hard to think on your toes I guess 😃 need to nail down those talking points, that’s a softball waiting to be hit out of the park.";"";"";

Let’s make up some flash cards for his next interview 😛 mm2 and AtomicDex, when people see how well it works, i think it has a serious chance of making a dent where others have failed.  I am concerned about the dex-cex liquidity solutions. They’re definitely something we need to take advantage of, but ultimately regulators will make it illegal. That said, it may just be a bit of a race. Once there’s sufficient dex liquidity, the cex interface /liquidity won’t be as necessary if at all.";"";"";
