I have been using the Atomic DEX app for a while now and have made a number of successful trades. It is really easy to use and the UX is generally fantastic. I do have one important piece of feedback on the trading interface, however.

You need to add the balance of each holding to the main trade screen when a sell or buy order is entered on the trading screens. Currently nothing is shown (at least on my version) when you select a particular coin to sell. If you don't want to trade your max balance, then as a user you are forced to go back to the previous screen and try to remember the balance and then enter ho much you want to trade. The balance of each coin account should be shown on the actual trade screen (& not just on the pop up window for coin selection). I have found that when demonstrating the App to others it is really easy to lose track of this information between screens. Other crypto wallet apps provide this information. You also provide it on the App's withdrawal screen. Ideally you should also show the equivalent value in USD.

I have also provided this feedback on the AtomicDEX website. Hopefully you will pick up this minor but important UX change. I can share a graphic of the suggested change if required.";"";"👍 (2),👌 (1),KMD (1)";
