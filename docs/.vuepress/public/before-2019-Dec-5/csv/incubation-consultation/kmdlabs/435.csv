easiest way is import your wif key on a 2nd node, but if your LABS NN is the only node that run LABS, then here's what I  would do:
- import your WIF with importprivkey.
- send out the necessary LABS amount from your imported address (at this point your wallet has 2 Raddies, 1 is your nota addy and the other is your newly imported, if you use `sendtoaddress` the inputs will be automatically chosen based on your amounts, so to make sure your tx uses the 2nd addy's utxo as input, you have to use `createrawtransaction` , `signrawtransaction` then `sendrawtransaction`) .
- now if you want to remove the 2nd wif key you just imported, stop LABS daemon, delete LABS wallet.dat (back it up first just in case), then relaunch with `./start.sh`";"";"👍 (1)";
