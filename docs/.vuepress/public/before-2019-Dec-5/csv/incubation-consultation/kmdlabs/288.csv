My advice is to use VerusHash11 algo unless you want Alright (or aanyone else for that matter) to go stalling it out on you. If its to be a apermenant chain, you can just use PoS ... on either equihash or verus shouldnt  matter which you choose. Verushash is CPU only, no GPU miners. 
I think 100% PoS chain works best on equihash if you go that way also.";"";"😂 (1)";

What I had to do was, calcualte the amount they are paid from 2 notarizations ago, so that the amount owed is from a state of chain that is itself notarized. That way a continious reorging of the chain, will simply stop notarisations all together until the attack stops, and once it stops normal operations will resume without forking the chain, creating the situation in LABSTRE where the chain contains an invalid block on sync. 

It was still possible for miners to include 2 notarizations in a block under a very very special case. I think that is now fixed. But this does mean that 3 notarizations have to happen BEFORE anyone can be paid. This will remove the ""bonus for notarizing first"" 😦";"";"";
