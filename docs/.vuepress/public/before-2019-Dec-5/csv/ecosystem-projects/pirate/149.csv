Any ""decaying price"" effect is short-term felt by very few of us, but I do agree that there will be lasting effects if sales don't pick up
The downturn of pricing is more an issue of shortsightedness as it relates to OTC. If it were possible to get people to see the larger picture and hold for an equilibrium price (ore even just under it) and get a few more buyers per day or 2, I have no doubt in growth ability.";"";"";
