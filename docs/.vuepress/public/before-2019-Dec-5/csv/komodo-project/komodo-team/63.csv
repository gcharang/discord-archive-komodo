Here is my contribution from the German telegram Komodo chat.
Translated with Google

Just my modest opinion: In over 25 years stock market, I have often put on the best technology. In the end, I still work today.
Most of those with the best marketing have won.
Therefore, I would not necessarily recommend today in the circle of friends to buy kmd.c
We absolutely need aggressive marketing, and very quickly. The technology and the ecosystem is absolutely great, but that does not help us if nobody is interested in investing.

Is it a platform for dApp development, a dICO platform, CC contracts, the KMD coin itself, etc. So if we are going to market one as a flagship, or all (though it is difficult to ""sell the world"") we need to have those aspects ready for easy use, building, and some examples built in. just flat out picking the right approach is difficult and is in process with the IBN team and Komodo, the marketing should promote a type of adoption, development, and usage that will drive value for KMD and it's holders, among other things.

i think we agree, thats we have with komodo a very good technic an a very good team. ( i admire their performance ) but some things must be advanced. to example JumbLE,  its to complicated for the masses. Whenever I use it I have problems. Only the native mode of agama is a challenge. That can not help inspire the masses.
But a anonymization tool, thats easy to use fort he masses, thats a very good argument for buy and use Komodo. A detour over another blockchain ( like pirate or whatever ), i think so, is not the right way.
I would like to give you to consider: In the past, not always has the best technology won. See Microsoft, Apple or whatever. it won the easy to use technic. technology, everyone is talking about. you know the answer of a question from the people when he say: ""google this""
I think we must see komodo everywhere. In coinbase? ( thats would a big step ) , in computer newspapers... I dont know,  im not a specialist.
Also I see many interesting projects in development. Thats very good, but I'm afraid komodo gets entangled in too many of these.
i think all of the team works hard and I hope their think about my constructive criticism.

I would like to thank the team for the successful work in 2018.
and wish us all a successful 2019.
Regards from Germany

Showcase the ease of use of running nodes vs Ethereum network's peer dropping node sync failures. This will essentailly end Ethereum, bring developers and clients to Komodo and thrust Komodo's market cap close to Bitcoin.

You will have to create professional press releases and marketing materials that must be sent out to financial & news publications as well as the cheesy blockchain news websites. Komodo must be dedicated and implacable in promoting this.

It would be the biggest shakeup in recent years, and crypto is due for a heavy shakeup. Komodo will be doing the industry a huge favor by extinguishing the Eth scam and saving the devs who are wasting their lives on it.";"";"";

"474019343727067147";"designer#4893";"27-Dec-18 01:28 PM";"The success of any crypto(ICO) depends on the actual value of the ecosystem. If an ecosystem is valuable, the token that is commonly used there is also valuable. Investors look for ideas and buy tokens in advance, expecting return on investment. As a resource to sell tokens, publishers create ecosystems. When ecosystems are created and activated, investors' expectations are realized. This is a virtuous cycle structure. It is self-prophecy reinforcement that expectation creates reality and reality reinforces expectation.

The problem is that the issuer sells the tokens while ensuring value is in conflict with traditional securities laws and investment regulations. The standard of judgment of securities does not appear. Because the issuer-investor relationship is the criterion, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims that most ICOs violated securities laws.

It is necessary to reverse the idea of ​​ensuring the value of the ecosystem rather than guaranteeing the value of the token. If an ecosystem has value, it can collect a variety of resources through the token without having to convert it to money or guarantee its value. It is not the mileage coupons that a valuable ecosystem meets with the block chain, but currency, so the government can not prevent it from being traditionally legal.";"";"";

Reason being is I remembered  the p2p market place Open Bazaar let's you buy crypto now too, but it is done through escrow or trusted trading. Seeing as Open Bazaar is p2p and relies on both parties being online, it makes it a perfect candidate for vendors to be liquidity providers for MM.
