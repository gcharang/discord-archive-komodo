there seems to be a common theme here.
I stumbled over the transkript of a Christine Lagarde speech (that stylish IMF pony), and I really tried to follow her thoughts- but failed.
Here are some excerpts regarding esp. prIvacy/anonymity - this provides an intriguing perspective on the mindset.
And it is really fascinating to realize: these.people.have.no.clue.whatsoever. 
This is circular thinking at its best:

' ...  should central banks issue a new digital form of money? '
...
'This currency could satisfy public policy goals, such as (i) financial inclusion, and (ii) security and consumer protection; and to provide what the private sector cannot: (iii) privacy in payments.'
...
'c) Privacy

The third benefit of digital currency I would like to highlight lies in the privacy domain. Cash, of course, allows for anonymous payments. We reach for cash to protect our privacy for legitimate reasons: to avoid exposure to hacking and customer profiling, for instance.

Consider a simple example. Imagine that people purchasing beer and frozen pizza have higher mortgage defaults than citizens purchasing organic broccoli and spring water. What can you do if you have a craving for beer and pizza but do not want your credit score to drop? Today, you pull out cash. And tomorrow? Would a privately-owned payment system push you to the broccoli aisle?

Would central banks jump to the rescue and offer a fully anonymous digital currency? Certainly not. Doing so would be a bonanza for criminals.'

'Central banks might design digital currency so that users’ identities would be authenticated through customer due diligence procedures and transactions recorded. But identities would not be disclosed to third parties or governments unless required by law. So when I purchase my pizza and beer, the supermarket, its bank, and marketers would not know who I am. The state might not either, at least by default.

Anti-money laundering and terrorist financing controls would nevertheless run in the background. If a suspicion arose it would be possible to lift the veil of anonymity and investigate.

This setup would be good for users, bad for criminals, and better for the state, relative to cash. Of course, challenges remain. My goal, at this point, is to encourage exploration.'
...
'The advantage is clear. Your payment would be immediate, safe, cheap, and potentially semi-anonymous. As you wanted. And central banks would retain a sure footing in payments. In addition, they would offer a more level playing field for competition, and a platform for innovation.'";"";"";

To be owner of a car or house you need to register it. When you register it it must be in line with taxes you pay. If you dont pay taxes and you have expensive things - they will investigate you and find out you got a lot from crypto (as example). Here does nto matter if it's private or not private. They can seize your devices and check what they like (you must be really well educated to know how to well encrypt your all devices and not make any mistakes on the way).
