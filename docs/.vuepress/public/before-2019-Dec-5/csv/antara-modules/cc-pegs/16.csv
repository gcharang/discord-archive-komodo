I have and idea to create another msig address from the same pubkeys (if possible) and move the funds that are used for withdraw over there. This would solve both parallel withdraw and the balance thing as we would know how much is left. Ofc, the withdraw should expire after sometime and those fund need to be returned to the deposit address so it can be used again and have correct balance. That part is IMHO little bit picky as we have to be sure funds are not stuck at temp address.";"";"";

- withdraw tx created by user
- when confirmed/notarized, oraclefeed takes one withdraw at the time and creates raw tx
- signing happens in mempool so it should be fast and while not signed completely no new withdraws are processed
- when it is signed completely it is broadcasted on external chain and markedone
- then new withdraw is taken from the queue and processed
So we have parallel withdraws created, but serial processing of them one by one (probably it can be more than one per block as everything happens in mempool).

And now thee is only the question of checking balance, as I think the n/2 consensus is not good because when the withdraw is broadcasted externally in that moment the balance is lowered and until it reaches n/2 nodes publishing it in the mean time another withdraw could be created. So I suggest we use minimum that is reporeted in latest oraclesdata. Even if some node reports false balance that is lower, it could only get withdraws halted until we resolve it.";"";"";
