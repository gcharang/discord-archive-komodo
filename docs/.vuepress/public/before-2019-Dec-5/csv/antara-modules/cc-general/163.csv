It seems from the code that `-ac_private` for total privacy is not supported and users are instead directed to use PIRATE instead.  Does that mean to make a Smart Chain using Pirate to achieve total privacy or is it suggesting you just use the Currency ARRR Instead?

```
fprintf(stderr,""-ac_private for a non-PIRATE chain is not supported. The only reason to have an -ac_private chain is for total privacy and that is best achieved with the largest anon set. PIRATE has that and it is recommended to just use PIRATE\n"");
