It sends to a new address? i thought it sent back to the original address
```

Yeah, we send to the next unused derivation path as per the BIP44 standard. Address re-use is bad for privacy and security. I don't think sending back to the same address is a good idea but I'm open to feedback.

More information here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim#why-do-all-my-funds-get-sent-back-to-a-new-address

And if you disagree with our decision, you can vote here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/issues/3

If enough people disagree with our decision then I'm definitely open to changing it.

```
how can I be sure that this new address is on my ledger before confirming the transaction?
```

One of the steps asks you to confirm the new address on your Ledger. The Ledger can't show arbitrary addresses, only addresses it can derive from it's internal private key. This provides cryptographic proof that the address shown on the device belongs to you.

If you follow all steps properly and compare the data displayed on the Ledger with the data displayed in the web app, it's impossible for a malicious site to steal your funds.";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:16 AM";"So to clarify, risk with new address is avoided by clarifying the new address on the device in step 2";"";"👍 (2)";

"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:17 AM";"However I understand that this makes people feel uncomfortable and they maybe don't realise that confirming the address on the device is cryptographic proof";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:18 AM";"I'm a firm believer that if users are complaining about something it's because the app's wrong not the users (even if the users are wrong too haha), so we definitely need to try and make this more clear";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:23 AM";"Also, just a consideration, but if we were to change the app to send back to old addresses, that could actually increase the opportunity for phishing attacks. As PTYX mentions, it gets a bit complicated when the account has multiple UTXOs across multiple different addresses.

We can send back to all the same addresses, however now instead of the users having to confirm one address that's been cryptographically derived on the device for them to check against, they have to check many. What if you have 20 addresses? You need to manually check 20 addresses on your Ledger device. It would be much easier for a phishing attack to sneak an incorrect address in here.

There's also the issue that I'm not even sure it's possible to click through 20 outputs on the Ledger without it timing out over the Web API. Which means the user has no choice but to blindly accept or not confirm at all due to timing out.";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:25 AM";"One way we could mitigate this is instead of claiming per-account, you claim per address. However that could be very tedious and time consuming if you've a lot of addresses. Considering Ledger Live is a BIP44 wallet so every transaction is +1 address and +1 UTXO";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:26 AM";"So yeah, we have considered all options, and I'm confident that what we have now is the easiest, safest and least error prone way of doing it.";"";"";
"360402743543988225";"lukechilds#2707";"14-Mar-19 01:26 AM";"But it is kind of confusing, hopefully this helps people understand our reasoning";"";"";

http://ledgerhq.github.io/ledgerjs/docs/

search for ""getWalletPublicKey(path, verify, segwit)"" and open that section up, you'll see the first argument is a BIP32 derivation path. There's no API method to pass in an arbitrary address to display. You can only pass a derivation path that will be derived on the device and then the resulting address will be displayed.";"";"";

lukechilds
thanks for you answers
also, re the devisor
I'm still not quite sure what exactly this is
when you get a value and devide it by a deviser it gives you the interest per minute, right?
so you can multiply that up for the duration of minutes to find the total interest amount
how did you actually calculate the value 10512000?
would just like to make the meaning a bit more clear in my code so I understand it when I come back to it

jl777c
it does all the multiplying and dividing needed to end up at 5% APR
i just combined numerator and denominator constants into a single one, but this way it avoids any overflow/underflow issues
in essence it is a constant. if you use half its value, then it will be 10% APR
if you use double the value 2.5% APR
it is just the constant that calculates 5% APR when used in the equation where it is
365 * 24 * 60 / 10512000 = 0.05
it is the divisor to use on the minutes in a year to get 5%
