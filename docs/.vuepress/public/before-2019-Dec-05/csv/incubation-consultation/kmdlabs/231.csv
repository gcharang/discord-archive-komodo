Jthis allows devs to make changes to a single file cclib.cpp and define a user defined CC that uses dynamic libraries so no need to even recompile komodod. this enables a separation of a user defined CC from komodod, yet is is part of komodod at runtime

For now, you need to go into src/cc dir and run ./makecclib to make the src/cclib.so file that will be searched for
the -ac_cclib=<name> must match the MYCCLIBNAME that is defined at the top of cclib.cpp
the name specified in -ac_cclib must match the name inside cclib.cpp
there is a CClib_Dispatch function that is called for evalcodes 0x10 to 0x7f (reserved for user defined CC)
what this means is that without rebuilding komodod, you can make a new CC that is inside cclib.cpp (and whatever files linked in to cclib.so) to do validation. For now, only the validation is added. for constructing CC tx, some external process will be needed which can be done however the custom CC wants it to
so for now, it is just a theoretical support for user defined CC, I guess we can make a pass through rpc that will invoke a custom CC rpc,but I leave that for someone else to do
