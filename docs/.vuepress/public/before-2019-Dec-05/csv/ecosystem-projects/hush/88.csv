I could have decided to do something about that on the new Hush v3 chain, but that is too slippery a slope. The cryptopia attack was very clearly a 51% attack and it effects 95% of Hush hodlers, unfortunately. It's very cut and dry. DP is not a situation I want to touch, for the reasons you describe CG";"";"";
