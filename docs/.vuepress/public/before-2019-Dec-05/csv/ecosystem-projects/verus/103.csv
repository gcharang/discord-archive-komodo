There are few others but they don’t have so much volume."" So crypto-bridge doesn't look so bad it seems. Are there any pros and cons to these DEXs that anyone is aware of, or anyone familiar with some of these platforms?";"";"";

Especially those who are here for the long run, contribute regularly to the project, etc.  If I were to look at it logically and make any unsubstantiated claims, it would make more sense to assume someone without a vested interest in and who doesn't contribute to the project's success would be dumping and potentially fudding the community to create ideal dump scenarios.";"";"";

DigitalPrice will be added to CMC at some point, and adding vrsc to more exchanges which are not well known or used, I don't see as benefiting the project. I stand by my initial reaction that there are better uses for 2 bitcoin.";"";"";

"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Jan-19 10:56 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I was going to ask the same question. Digital price is good. I have hand no problems using it. Also, if Crypto Union comes out making fiat a smooth transition, then I am really happy about this. But,  we do need to encourage users as quickly as possible or we might find that another coin (unknown as yet) with a similar application of verus becomes more popular.";"";"";
"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Jan-19 11:07 AM";"[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> When Verus was announced, it was done so on Bitcointalk. That's the standard. When you go to find the price & price history on CMC, you can't find it. 
People expect it to be on CMC and there's a level of trust, that comes with that.

Maybe it's just me--and I know a few btc is a lot, it really is. But, in some, way, shape or form---most other projects have paid many times over that, for listings..";"";"";

And in order to do that, we need exposure.
It's about time more of the crypto community starts to know who Verus is";"";"";

But than again, we should know which exchanges wants how much listing fee exactly to compare if crypto-bridge is a good deal or not.";"";"";
