Big investors in the coin will want there to be lots of powerful miners to protect their investment and transactions. 2. Big miners will want to put work into securing the network in order to protect their investment on hardware and the currency they want to sell. 3. New casual users of the coin will use a coin with lots of people incentives to protect it. But yeah, if their is not enough incentives from time to time, then they can suffer attacks. But obviously I'm a noob in this and I'm interested in seeing how this pos works.";"";"";

They spend to the first exchange, then mine enough to cause a reorg in which they omit this transaction, and as such may now spend it again to another exchange. It's not only really, really likely to completely shatter trust in a coin - even if people hold it up, it's clear that the coin is not safe. The effect is pretty much catastrophic on success.";"";"";

I think it's a question for the community, and community response will likely determine the final outcome. CryptoBridge is actually interesting in light of the Cryptopia hack, as it is a dex where you keep your own keys locally.";"";"";

How much has already been spent on listings-- I seem to recall there have been multiple fees paid without actually getting listed, and that most of the listings that actually happened didn't even cost anything?";"";"";
