""Welcome to the Komodo community! Thanks for dropping by our Discord community.""
```**

*Komodo is an open, composable blockchain platform. With a unique multi-chain design, Komodo is focused on providing fully composable blockchain solutions for independent developers, startups, and enterprise businesses alike. It’s a fascinating environment and the Komodo community is currently growing at an unprecedented rate.

There are many different aspects to Komodo. To help get you familiar with the ecosystem, this guide will answer some common questions and provide a basic overview of Komodo Platform.*

**```json
""When was the Komodo project started?""
```**

*The foundational idea for Komodo Platform was born on February 21, 2016, when James ‘jl777’ Lee published his Declaration of Independence:

""We the asset holders hereby declare our independence from any single blockchain.

An open and jointly developed specification on cross-chain atomic asset transfers will be developed. Any current or future blockchain is invited to join. 

Each blockchain will need to not only promise protections for asset holder interests, they need to live up to them. Otherwise, all the assets will simply move to blockchains that do.….

This is an interop standards effort and it needs to be blockchain agnostic and asset centric.""

— James ‘jl777’ Lee

Later that year, Komodo held its initial coin offering to make this remarkable vision a reality.*";"";"";
"591555923533758484";"alperC#7758";"16-Jul-19 10:28 AM";"**```json
""Did Komodo have an ICO?""
```**

*Yes. Komodo held an ICO that lasted just over one month, from Oct 15 to Nov 20 of 2016. KMD was sold a rate of 0.00012908222 BTC per coin, or 7747 KMD for 1 BTC.

One-hundred million KMD coins were issued, with 70% of the KMD swapped to BTCD holders, 20% sold to investors, and the remaining 10% held as working capital for Komodo’s development and marketing. 

Over the course of the ICO, Komodo Platform raised a total of 2,639 BTC. The closing price of BTC on November 20, 2016 was $731.03. At that price, we see that Komodo raised a total of $1,929,188 USD.

The BTC raised in the ICO is used almost exclusively to pay BTC transaction fees necessary for the Delayed Proof of Work security mechanism to function.*

""What are the specifications of the Komodo blockchain?""
```**

*Here are some basic facts about the Komodo blockchain and KMD coins:

    Block time -- 1 Minute
    Block size -- 4 Mb max.
    Consensus -- Proof of Work (PoW)
    Security -- delayed Proof of Work (dPoW)
    Algorithm -- Equihash
    Currently KMD Supply -- approximately 115 Million
    Total KMD Supply -- ~200 Million (will be reached around 2030)
    Transaction fees -- 0.001 KMD (third-party wallets may impose additional fees)*";"";"";

""What has Komodo accomplished since the ICO?""
```**

*Since the Komodo mainnet went live in January 2017, Komodo has consistently made one enormous development after another. There are really too many achievements to list them all here, but to highlight a few:

- Komodo is the industry’s most advanced composable blockchain platform. https://komodoplatform.com/technology/
- Komodo is the world leader in atomic swap technology. https://komodoplatform.com/atomic-swaps/
- Komodo launched the beta version of AtomicDEX, a mobile-ready, asset-agnostic atomic swap DEX application. https://atomicdex.io
- Komodo was the first blockchain project to offer support for UTXO smart contracts on a BTC-protocol coin. https://komodoplatform.com/crypto-conditions-utxo-based-smart-contracts/
- Komodo built the Antara Framework, a flexible framework for end-to-end blockchain development. http://komodoplatform.com/antara-framework
- Komodo launched the demo version of the Antara Smart Chain Composer, an automated blockchain generating web application.  https://composer.kmd.io

""What is Komodo all about?""
```**

*Stated simply, Komodo’s technology provides the tools that developers, startups, and enterprise businesses need to create a customized blockchain to host an application, software, or other blockhain-based solution. All of Komodo’s development is driven by the principles of composability. 

Composability is a design principle focused on providing a wide array of components, which can be activated as needed and used in different configurations to meet the unique demands of a specific use case. Composable systems place emphasis on enabling fully modular, rapidly-deployable solutions that are powered by a fluid set of resources to support growth.

Komodo has achieved the requirements of composability with the Antara Framework, a flexible framework for end-to-end blockchain development.

With the principle of composability in mind, Komodo is working towards its mission of accelerating global blockchain adoption through a flexible multi-chain architecture, an open platform model, and a business-friendly ecosystem that allows developers, startups, and enterprise alike to prosper with customized blockchain solutions.*";"";"";

""What makes Komodo unique?""
```**

*Komodo is distinct from other blockchains in several ways. 

First, the Komodo Platform is built atop a multi-chain architecture that can support an unlimited number of independent Smart Chains. 

Ordinary smart contract platforms are but a single blockchain with one network for all third-party projects to share. This single, shared blockchain architecture is a recipe for crippling congestion, high gas fees, and long transaction wait times.

Komodo is unique because of its multi-chain architecture, which gives every project their very own dedicated blockchain with independent infrastructure. If one chain isn’t providing adequate performance, additional chains can be added to scale out and increase performance linearly. 

Second, Komodo is distinct from other multi-chain platforms in that Komodo offers complete autonomy. Some multi-chain interoperability projects impose a rental model, in which projects must continue to pay fees to maintain their application-specific blockchain. Other multi-chain projects force projects to pay high fees in the platform’s native coin for essential services.

While Komodo does offer platform services that are paid in KMD— Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) Security and Platform Synchronizations— third-party projects can decide whether or not to use them. 

For instance, a project that builds with Komodo can choose to make their Smart Chain Proof of Stake (PoS), which would eliminate many of the security vulnerabilities that new PoW networks face. Or, a project that builds with Komodo could use dPoW’s open source code and establish their own network of notary nodes to receive Bitcoin-level security without paying fees in KMD.

Ultimately, Komodo provides a level of independence that no other platform can offer.*";"";"";

""What is Komodo working on now?""
```*

*Development at Komodo happens at breakneck speed so it can change on a week-to-week basis, but here are a few things that the Komodo Team is currently focusing on:

Constantly improving and adding coins to AtomicDEX, the ecosystem’s native multi-coin wallet and mobile-ready atomic swap DEX combined into one, easy-to-use app.
Creating new features and customization options for Antara Smart Chains
Building up the Antara Module library in order to provide third-party projects with more performance boosting options.
Continuing to improve upon the Antara Smart Chain Composer, an automated web application that lets users customize and launch a sovereign Smart Chain in minutes.
Integrating more external blockchains to Komodo’s delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) security service network.

This is only a partial list but it includes most of the major developments currently taking place at Komodo Platform.*

""What are the primary use cases of KMD?""
```**

*KMD is the native currency in the Komodo ecosystem. It has a number of important uses.

- Those who hold 10 KMD or more can easily earn 5% active user rewards.
- KMD trading pairs get a 10% discount in trading fees on AtomicDEX mobile.
- KMD is also the most widely-traded coin on AtomicDEX, so KMD can act as a go-between for two other tokens that do not yet have a direct market between them.
- KMD is the currency in which the Delayed Proof of Work Security and Platform Synchronizations services are paid.
- KMD holders are allowed to participate in Komodo’s annual Notary Node Election, meaning that they have the ability to help choose who operates the Notary Nodes.*";"";"";
