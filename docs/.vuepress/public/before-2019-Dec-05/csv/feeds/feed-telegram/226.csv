I'm seriously thinking on not using their wallet anymore, can't trust them after all this! 😕 (re @Regnar: EVERYONE!! please be careful if you have input a seed phrase into Coinomi windows wallet (not sure of which other versions have this security flaw too) but apparently Coinomi seed input sends your seed phrase, in clear text(not encrypted), to Google's servers to spell check.

Different blockchains mine blocks at different speeds, bitcoin roughly 10 minutes, Komodo roughly 1 minute. Others are different too. It does have an effect on how big the blockchain gets itself which causes problems for Ethereum, but Komodo uses multi chains so you dont need to sync all the chains.
