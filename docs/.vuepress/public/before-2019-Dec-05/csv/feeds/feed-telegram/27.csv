"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"22-Jun-18 12:37 PM";"[telegram] <Regnar> Thank you haha again i understand projects that focus on their product, that's what we want, we don't want devs absolutely beholden to investor demands otherwise we'll have too much short term influence trying to sway the price short term for quick flips, which actually hurts long term prospects. But that doesn't mean devs shouldn't take into account the investors at all. I think Komodo does a good job of striking this balance. The efforts being made are real and tangible in order to benefit everyone, and marketing department is a fully funded entity designed to help investors via product knowledge and adoption. But it can still feel like shit to open blockfolio and see red. So I totally understand that, which is why I try and explain things like this, rationally for an investor. There are risks to investing in vapor, it's much better to invest in legit projects, regardless of what charts say, simply because that vapor will disappear eventually and all that will remain is projects with strong networks, strong tech, unique capabilities, and hashing power.
