"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"19-Sep-19 10:10 PM";"[telegram] <PMasss> The day of the pump is approaching. Three more days and we will unite and mass buy a coin. While mass buying, our social media specialists will spread bullish news on some massive social media channels. 
The news combined with the upgoing price will make outsiders (people that are not in Lion signals)  FOMO, this will make the coin rise even further. After this price rise, slowly sell your coins. Instead of one order, place a couple.
More people means a bigger rise in price which means a bigger profit. So, do not forget to invite people to our discord and Telegram.

After seeing the good testimonies about Mr Luis Marcelo.  I actually decided to try again this time with a intention of getting all I have lost. And to GOD be the glory,i was able to regain all and had more for keep. I urge you all to stop investing on fake websites.  Stand up and go for a real investment.

•Beta testing phase now
•Liquidity solutions
•Stress tests
•Roll-out @ end of year, i guess?
•What is the strategy for getting as many coins listed as possible?
•And finally will there be marketing or some kinda campaigning towards the release?
Also, how much users are actually wanted / needed now as Atomic Dex is still in beta..? I mean it would be easy to multiply the user amounts right away by spreading some information, interviews and so on. Generally speaking I am interested in the strategy part of Atomic Dex roll-out";"";"";
