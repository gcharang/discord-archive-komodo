A few weeks ago, we've launched one of two new flagship products, the AtomicDEX. Because the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we’ve decided to hold an AMA. You can ask the team anything regarding more information about the development, timelines, future plans for AtomicDEX and so on.

We are asking our community to post their questions in this channel, and we'll choose the most popular ones based on how many ￼⬆  each question receives. We will also answer questions live, if time permits.";"";"";
