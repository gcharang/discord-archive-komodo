A transaction is a signed message containing the following data:
• Sender address: The account address of the transaction sender. The VM reads the sequence number, authentication key, and balance from the LibraAccount.T resource stored under this address.
• Sender public key: The public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign the transaction. The hash of this public key must match the authentication key stored under the sender’s LibraAccount.T resource.
• Program: A Move bytecode transaction script to execute, an optional list of inputs to the script, and an optional list of Move bytecode modules to publish.
• Gas price: The number of Libra coins that the sender is willing to pay per unit of gas in order to execute this transaction.
• Maximum gas amount: The maximum number of gas units that the transaction is allowed to consume before halting.
• Sequence number: An unsigned integer that must be equal to the sequence number from the sender’s LibraAccount.T resource. After this transaction executes, the sequence number is incremented by one. Since only one transaction can be committed for a given sequence number, transactions cannot be replayed.";"";"";

Satoshi Nakamoto brought the technology he had and woven it. His genius is that he made a flawless game board with proof of electric consumption work. this is because the proof of electric consumption is proof of work while the blockchain is all proof of work. (PoW is a common element of almost all blockchain)

the bottom line is that the 'proof of electric work' does not waste electricity. In fact, I can't do that even if I try. this is what the theory foresaw and recently published the results of a bitcoin mining study in CoinShares, as the theory says.

If the bitcoin system can be said to be beautiful, it goes on in real life as the theory predicts, and that is almost because of the integrity of the game of attesting to electric consumption.

once again, Satoshi Nakamoto's genius lies in his near-perfect reproduction of the axiom of microeconomics in reality and in his humanities insights that penetrate human collective psychology.";"";"💯 (1)";

As they are still immature, local differences exist along borders such as kimchi premium, but they disappear as soon as the mainstream financial sector intervenes in the pursuit. This is because there is no storage or transport cost before physical Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin will be a pressure in the direction of unifying electricity prices around the world. In countries that subsidize electricity prices, individuals will retaliate against regulations that run counter to the market by increasing mining. This is because subsidizing electricity can be mined not only with waste electricity in the off-season, but also with electricity in the peak season. Since the price of electricity needed to obtain additional Bitcoin will converge on the market price of Bitcoin, enormous pressures unrelated to consumed resources such as oil, nuclear power and even hydro and wind power will attempt to unify the price globally.

However, electricity prices are likely to be affected by latitude, not by border. This is because the coolers used to cool the miner consume an additional 20 percent of electricity, which can be expensive in cold areas. This is because mining can be done without turning the cooling machine. In other words, cold regions can only raise their electricity bills within the limits of electricity bills consumed by coolers compared to hot ones.";"";"";

no storage cost? You neglect the fact of millions of $ of hardware used to store the blockchain.
No transport costs? You neglect the ISP fees, BTC transfer fees to get stuff moving.

Bitcoin (and general) mining consumes MWs of clean electricity, that could have been distributed to areas where non-green energy is used. Therefore it possibly slows the integration of green energy, because fossil fueled power stations need to be kept running. Economic Bitcoin mining depends on energy prices, not the other way around.

As long as humanity regards excess heat as a waste product that needs to be expelled into earths atmosphere, it will only hurt out ecosystem. If you don’t have the natural environment to cool without machines, the heat pollution is even bigger.

I don’t say mining is bad, but it will definitely not save the world, the climate or the energy prices.";"";"";
