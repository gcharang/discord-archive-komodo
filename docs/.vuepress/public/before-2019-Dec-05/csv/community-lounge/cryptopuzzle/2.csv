**Wen Moon Puzzle**

Wen Moon was a chinese McDonald's manager. After hard work week he got drunk ... ) And sent last 0.5 DEX from his wallet to this address https://dex.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u and forget about it. But in 2045, when 1 DEX = 500 BTC he remember about it and start trying to recover his funds ... The only one thing that he remember about ""sent day"" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk ))";"";"rum (1)";
