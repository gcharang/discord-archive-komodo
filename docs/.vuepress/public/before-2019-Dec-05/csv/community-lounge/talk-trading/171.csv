I think people, as a whole, tend to see what they are told is ""good"" over doing any research to decide what they personally believe is ""good"". There are any number of reasons that Komodo gets overlooked, ranging from small amount of coders to the age old ""fight"" of ""'no one' has heard of it because 'no one has heard of it'"" (the latter being the inverse of ""'everyone' is on Farcebook because 'everyone is on Farcebook'""";"";"";
