People might take out some money after new year to pay taxes and dec/jan has often weak price action / low volume. This is like to bring the price down a notch till around 88% which brings us to ~2200$ (previous resistance on the monthly candle, again this is similar to the 2013 bubble.)
The wick did extend further below. Last line of defense would be previous ATH at 1170$.
1170 is a 94% drop from ATH to old ATH. I expect resistance at the 200weekly MA and strong resistance at previous resistance of old ATH.";"";"👍 (1)";
