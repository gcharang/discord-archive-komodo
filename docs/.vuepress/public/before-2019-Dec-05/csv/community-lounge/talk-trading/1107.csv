The dream of bitcoin and crypto in general was to gain freedom, not losing it. Komodo is building the tools like atomic swaps, dex, pirate... they are definitely top quality crypto tech. 
1. Pirate, best anon tech today which is zk-snarks from zcash done right. 99.9%+ shielded tx, biggest anon set, btc level security. I don’t see stronger privacy anywhere yet, I could be wrong though.
2. Dex (atomic, hyper, chain swap, all built on mm2) allows trustless exchange between any coin from ethereum ecosystem to bitcoin and btc clones. IMO there is no competition with working product on the market yet. Pls correct me if I am wrong. 
--- Update: there is more ---
3. Komodo, freedom for developers, tax free zone for your projects, smart chains are easy to create (antara), can be secured with btc hashrate, own fee policy, leveraging proven komodo tech saving 10s of thousands+ dollars for maintaining and securing their chain.
4. nSPV, latest improvment of electrum tech will allow ""lightweight yet secure"" wallet clients. 
5. Ecosystem. Being part of the Komodo ecosystem can have huge benefits for new blockchain startup like R&D cost reduction, DEX liquidity, fund raising, using all the new Komodo tech and OS codebase basically for free.";"";"💯 (3)";

If the dex goes well, using kmd will have highest liquidity, cheaper fees, and also ability to have 0 confirmation trading. If you have BNB valued so highly based off trading fee discounts, imagine what kmd could do as well";"";"";
