scaling solution is NOT about single chain, but multiple blockchains working as a group, a cluster, like a 1 single organism??
the way scaling solution works, it is already proven to show over 45,000+ transactions per second.
that demonstration showed how the scaling solution works. It doesn't actually need another demonstration, but it is good for marketing to show such demonstration, as kinda people believe what they see. I don't have update on scaling. Just join #dev-scalability to ask and know more on it.
there is factually no limit to the limit of transactions per second as per the solution provided by Komodo.";"";"🚀 (1)";
