I didn't have time yet to deep-in inside XMR, due election preparation tasks, but seems XMR forks is totally different from Bitcoin-based coins and it's will very hard and impressive work if we can get it compatible with Iguana. From KMD side seems all remains the same (mean, how the nota tx is created, signing process and others). But from XMR side, currently it looks for me as a ""deep jungle"" or ""other planet"". First, XMR uses  RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) protocol, instead of well-known bitcoin protocol. It means (for me) that i totally don't know how to construct, sign and verify tx in XMR-based coin network. But one thing i know (it's good), seems it's possible to create and sign multisig tx with - prepare_multisig, make_multisig, finalize_multisig daemon RPC's (but this is also, still ""deep jungle"", bcz i'm  quickly read about it, but didn't tried). Also, all bitcoin forks, including kmd and zcash is utxo based. And iguana work guessed work with utxos ... but in XMR seems things are different, if i'm don't wrong with it: ""Monero doesn’t have an UTXO set (the whole blockchain is the TXO set)"" ... so, for now, i'm totally confused how XMR work and how dPOW should work in XMR. Hope, it's only for now, and future learning will clear something for me.";"";"👀 (2)";

We have pay-to-scripthash type transactions as well.   The issue that @dukeleto is running into is probably the result of PoW hashes only being included in block hashes implicitly.  However, that's somewhat irrelevant to the ability for notarization nodes to be able to recognize a specific transaction.. within each transaction that occurs, we have a ""tx_extra"" field which is publicly viewable from the blockchain and is the same field that pools use for pool nonce.";"";"";
