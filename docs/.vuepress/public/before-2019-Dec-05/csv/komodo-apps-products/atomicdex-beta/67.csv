Are there plans to allow offers to specify a minimum as well as a floating price based on a rate from an exchange?  For instance, I'd like to sell some BTC at 10% over spot and don't want to come back and update the price every hour.  Also, a minimum purchase amount would be nice as the little stuff just isn't worth dealing with.

Thank you for the cool app!";"";"";

atm, there is a fixed minvolume deep in the code, which helps avoiding $1-trades with BTC and paying $1 txfees for those... it helps a lot
to set and update prices i use my own script: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools";"";"";
