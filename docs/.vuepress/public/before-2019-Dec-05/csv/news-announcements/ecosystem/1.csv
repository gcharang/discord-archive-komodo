"457001023928795136";"kimmel (Pungo.io)#2275";"09-Jul-18 04:07 PM";"Good afternoon, I have received several questions regarding the possibility of adding AC to the services we are developing. Let me share some thoughts on it:

1 - Any AC needs to have people willing to buy or sell (orderbooks), which probably means there is people that beliefs in the product and has real market expectations, thus a buy-sell market comes to exist

2-  A market can be a centralized exchange (which involves listing efforts and trusting a 3rd party) or a DEX like Barterdex. Unfortunately BarterDex seems to be not yet ready to give a ""granma friendly"" experience. Thus creating enough ""market liquidity"" through BarterDex seems yet not a possibility. Other DEX's like the ones that trade tokens based in ETH already have acceptable liquidity pools, which means you can find acceptable orderbooks and volumes (kyber.network, oasis.dex etc)

3- For now, getting some liquidity on a KMD based Asset Chain means getting listed into a centralized Exchange, like Utruum has recently done.

That said , feel free to contact us regarding integrating AC onto our growing product portfolio
