 anybody can create a game by specifying maxplayers and buyin. Buyin of 0.00 ROGUE is for newbies and a good way to get experience. All players will start in the identical level, but each level after that will be unique to each player.
 
 There are two different modes that is based on the maxplayers. If maxplayers is one, then it is basically a practice/farming game where there are no time limits. Also, the gold -> ROGUE conversion rate is cut in half. You can start a single player game as soon as the newgame tx is confirmed.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"06-Feb-19 05:32 PM";"If maxplayers is more than one, then it goes into highlander mode. There can only be one winner. Additionally, multiplayer mode adds a timelimit of ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP (60) blocks between keystrokes updates. That is approx. one hour and every level it does an automatic update, so as long as you are actively playing, it wont be a problem. The is ROGUE_REGISTRATION blocks waiting period before any of the players can start. The random seed for the game is based on the future blockhash so that way, nobody is able to start before the others.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"06-Feb-19 05:32 PM";"rogue is not an easy game to win, so it could be that the winner for a specific group is simply the last one standing. If you bailout of a game you cant win, but you can convert all the ingame gold you gathered at 0.001 ROGUE each. [In the event that there arent enough globally locked funds to payout the ROGUE, you will have to wait until there is. Since 10% of all economic activity creates more globally locked funds, it is just a matter of time before there will be enough funds to payout. Also, you can help speed this up by encouraging others to transact in ROGUE]
 
 Of course, the most direct way to win, is to get the amulet and come back out of the dungeon. The winner will get all of the buyins from all the players in addition to 0.01 ROGUE for every ingame gold.
 
 The above alone is enough to make the timeless classic solitaire game into a captivating multiplayer game, where real coins are at stake. However, there is an even better aspect to ROGUE! Whenever your player survives a game, even when you bailout, the entire player and his pack is preserved on the blockchain and becomes a nonfungible asset that you can trade for ROGUE.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"06-Feb-19 05:32 PM";"Additionally, instead of just being a collectors item with unique characteristics, the rogue playerdata can be used in any ROGUE game. Just specify the txid that created your character when you register and your character is restored. The better your characteristics your playerdata has, the more likely you are to win in multiplayer mode to win all the buyins. So there is definite economic value to a strong playerdata.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"06-Feb-19 05:32 PM";"You can farm characters in single player mode to earn ROGUE or to make competitive playerdata sets. You can purchase existing playerdata for collecting, or for using in battle.
Here is how to play:
 
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 \""[3,10]\"" -> this will create a hex transaction that when broadcast with sendrawtransaction will get a gametxid onto the blockchain. This specific command was for 3 players and a buyin of 10 ROGUE. Lets assume the gametxid is 4fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a, most all the other commands will need the gametxid.
 
 you can always find all the existing games with:
 
  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib pending 17
 
 and info about a specific game with:
 
  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib gameinfo 17 \""[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22]\""
 due to quirks of various parsing at the shell, rpc and internal level, the above convention is used where %22 is added where "" should be. also all fields are separated by , without any space.";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"06-Feb-19 05:32 PM";"When you do a gameinfo command it will show a ""run"" field and that will tell you if you are registered for the game or not. If not, the ""run"" field shows the register syntax you need to do, if you are registered, it will show the command line to start the rogue game that is playing the registered game.
 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib register 17 \""[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22,%22playerdata_txid%22]\""
 If you want to cash in your ingame gold and preserve your character for another battle, do the bailout:
 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \""[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22]\""
 If you won your game before anybody else did or if you are the last one left who didnt bailout, you can claim the prize:
 
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib highlander 17 \""[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22]\""
 The txid you get from the bailout or highlander transactions is the ""playerdata_txid"" that you can use in future games.";"";"🎉 (3),😮 (1)";

Rogue does  utilize fungible tokens (unique cryptoassets) which can technically represent digital cryptographic collectibles - remember the cryptokitties? Well with ROGUELANDER your character becomes the collectible and no longer remains a useless cryptographic key but rather an avatar/character that can be used for gameplay and even traded.";"";"";

although using decentralized in-game currencies is an obvious major use case.
The sad answer is that gaming is incredibly centralized and that gaming companies fear any whiff of real-world monetary connection like Count Dracula fears the sunlight.
Just imagine Blizzard issueing WoW tokens fungible other than through _their_ servers - the thought alone keeps corp execs shivering awake at night...
So again, it is up for grabs for independent start ups";"";"";
