`Recent changes to the protocol made it possible to attach arbitrary data to a payment. This demo leverages that by attaching a text message and a sender signature.

A Lightning payment delivers the message, but no actual money is paid. Because the sender uses a random payment hash, the receiver is not able to settle the payment. The failure message that is returned to the sender serves as a delivery confirmation.

This means that chatting is currently free. However, there is a future in which 'free failures' don't exist anymore. Nodes may start charging a prepaid relay fee and/or start rate limiting sources that produce too many failures. In that case, chatting over Lightning may switch to actually settling the messaging payments and dropping off a few millisats at every hop.`";"";"🔥 (2)";

It has close to complete FSM artefact set (while it is an early draft, of course) and has 2 examples how to implement existing cc with it.
It has a description for json structure defining FSM states, events and transitions.
The complicated thing in this is expressions which could be embedded into a fsm definition and will be evaluated by FSM CC module.
With the expressions it is possible to define logical conditions or action to enable/disable a transition or check if a event occured or make some actions on blockchain artefacts.
The goal of this is to allow by developing just fsm json definitions, with no coding, to create various new CC applications based on the single FSM CC module.
https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/wiki/Designing-RPC-for-FSM-CC
I'm trying to borrow concepts from UML State Diagram (believing that it is a well-defined and consistent framework).
---
If all this is close to what we want to have as a FSM module, the next steps could be to create more example definitions to get to the point when the specification becomes stable and artefacts reusable, so it would not need to extend it more and more for each new task.";"";"🔥 (5),💯 (4),👌 (6),KMD (4)";

I just pushed some updates to my app:

- adding some functionalities like token transferring, ask/bid orders placing/filling (based on the existing RPC methods) which allow users to trade their tokens.

PHBA's solution is very similar to cors-anywhere
except, it uses express as the proxy server in between

there is no removing CORS lol, there is only removing CORS problems 🙂 
in the case of localhost to localhost comms,  we can have a local proxy server (cors-anywhere or PHBA's express based one) to act as an inbetween for communicating with the Komodo daemon as it doesn't reply with the proper CORS headers which the browsers look for as a security policy

if we are dealing with an internet API that doesn't set CORS properly, we can have a similar proxy server hosted on a VPS to act as a go between for communicating with the particular API
 <https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/> is a demo of that kind of usage";"";"";

Express CORS proxy, yeah I did same thing for nodejs mmbot github.com/imylomylo/node-cors-server/blob/master/index.js for Initial GUI work before the bot was developed.  This too didn’t respond with CORS headers, but for my dev env I simply made an ssh tunnel from CORS to wherever the bot was.  One proxy, several docker bots

Thanks for info re SSR vs other.  I’m not familiar with nuxt - a case of too many frameworks to learn their opinionated ways of doing things 🙃 but if I can make work with sample apps and remove CORS-anywhere, more power to me!
