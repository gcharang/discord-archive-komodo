would be good to get a channel anyway to keep everything in one place, I'll probs come back with regular questions regarding the reward claiming
we hit a little road block with the app, it turns out the current official KMD app implements BTC consensus rule checks on the TX before signing
and having an output amount larger than the input amount violates this and causes the Ledger to throw an error
You can see the function here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

For more context it's called from here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/main.c#L1987

I've ""fixed"" this with a pretty simple hack here: https://github.com/lukechilds/ledger-app-btc/commit/e2ebcada593710faf8f438bd26d21a170a3b60d4

Allow Ledger to sign Komodo reward claim transactions · lukechild...

it works, and bypasses the check for KMD
However the txfee amounts shown to the user now overflow for reward claim transactions
I wanted to implement the reward amount calculations on the device but:
1) It is completely incompatible with the current BTC protocol coin codebase
2) I'm almost certain Ledger won't accept a PR with all that code";"";"";
"455741312273219595";"jl777c#5810";"19-Oct-18 11:56 AM";"The device has no concept of UTXO height or current block height, it just knows about inputs and outputs and signs them. So we'd need to completely fork the BTC app, add support for passing block height info to the Ledger, implement all the KMD interest consensus rules on the device, and then fork their API client and add the block height support to that too. :/
so the current solution is preferable to that
just force allowing any output amount
Just wanted your opinion on if this change is ok, I don't think it should have any negative effects
The only down side I can see is, if the outputs are larger than the inputs the txfee value overflows so it displays the txfee as like a bazillion KMD
but that would only ever happen if the output amount is larger than the input amount
e.g with an reward claim TX
normal TXs will show up fine
so no normal software is likely to encounter this
worst case scenario possible, someone accidentally crafts a TX that has way more outputs than inputs and sends it to the ledger to sign, the Ledger signs it without error, then they broadcast it to the network and it gets rejected instantly
no loss of funds
it will just sign TXs that break the consensus rules in the single scenario that the outputs are too large
I think
but yeah, I'm a little out of my depth, I'm not very familiar with C at all
so would be great to get your opinion on that
and also if you or anyone else can see an obvious way to not make the txfee overflow so we can show negative fees like on explorers rather that ridiculously high numbers that would be great too";"";"";

So if we had a few lines wrapped in an if check for KMD, (like it is now) they'll likely accept. If we go and rewrite large portions of the codebase that effects all currencies (the tx fee display) just to fix a bug in a very specific use case for one alt coin, I think they're much less likely to accept.";"";"";

It's the function that calculates the txfee here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71
The first argument `target` is the txfee. It's an `unsigned char` which seems confusing to me as it's a number. After some reading it seems an `unsigned char` is an ascii character AKA a number in the range 0...255 AKA an 8-bit integer.

So I'm not sure how it's getting interpreted as that huge number. I tried changing into a `signed char` which I thought might allow negative numbers but got the same issue. Maybe because `255` is hardcoded into the calculations as they're expecting it to be limited to 0...255?";"";"";
