Here is the link of the current minified JavaScript bundle being served by magnum wallet: https://app.magnumwallet.co/dist/build.js?v=99

You can search for the string ""getKomodoRewards"" which should bring you to this section of code:

```
{key:""getKomodoRewards"",value:function(t,e,r,n){var i=Math.floor((t-e)/60);if(r>=7777777||e<5e8||n<1e9||i<60)return 0;var o=r>=1e6?44640:525600,a=Math.min(i,o);a-=59;var s=Math.floor(n/10512e3)*a;return Math.max(0,s)}}
```

This is a line for line direct copy of our getKomodoRewards() function here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/komodo-ledger-reward-claim/blob/master/src/lib/get-komodo-rewards.js

It looks different because it's been run through a build system and transpiled, minified and bundled. However if you view the logic line by line and compare it with our file you'll see it's functionally identical. 

if you run our function through a build system it'll come out looking the same.

I've added newlines at the end of each statement in the Magnum copy below if you want to compare it to our version more easily.

```
{
    key: ""getKomodoRewards"",
    value: function(t, e, r, n) {
        var i = Math.floor((t - e) / 60);
        if (r >= 7777777 || e < 5e8 || n < 1e9 || i < 60) return 0;
        var o = r >= 1e6 ? 44640 : 525600,
            a = Math.min(i, o);
        a -= 59;
        var s = Math.floor(n / 10512e3) * a;
        return Math.max(0, s)
    }
