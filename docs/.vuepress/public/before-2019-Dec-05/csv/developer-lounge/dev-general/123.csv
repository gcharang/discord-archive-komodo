```First, UTXO-based smart contracts can be written in C, C++, or any other compiled programming language that can create a linkable library capable of calling and being called by C/C++ functions. In that sense, Komodo’s UTXO-based smart contracts are language agnostic. This also means Komodo’s smart contracts are Turing complete and can be programmed to do just about anything.```

This mostly doesn't make sense. There are two distinct things: 1)The coin daemon
2) The blockchain
The daemon has the rules the chain needs to follow but, the same coin daemon can allow different blockchains to exist.
i.e., ex: the BTC daemon controls the BTC blockchain, but using the same daemon, I can create a new chain that will be mined from block 1 but it is not BTC eventhough it has the same rules";"";"";
