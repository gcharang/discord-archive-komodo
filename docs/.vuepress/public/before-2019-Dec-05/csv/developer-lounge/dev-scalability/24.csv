I noticed yesterday there are 3 small 8 core instances left running on the KomodoPlatform account, doesn't seem like they cost a huge amount, just wondering if you got them working or just forgot to shut them down. 
My Internet changes over (to FTTN) on the 27th of July, so I would say if we dont get the next stage up and running by then, it would be best to leave the 256 chain test until next month when @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 2 is back from holidays and hopefully both our Internet connections are up and running. This also leaves plenty of time for marketing to work out their end. 
Of course we need to test a small 24 chain test on kubernetes first to make sure your YAML etc is correct and everything is working with my recent changes. I have ported the dockerfile and all scripts so its the same for all chains, and everything is set in the docker-compose.yml so set-up should be trivial in that regard.";"";"";
