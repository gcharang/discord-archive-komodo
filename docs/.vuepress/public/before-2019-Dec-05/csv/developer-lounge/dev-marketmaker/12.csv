1. Libtorrent DHT as networking layer for swap.
2. New simplified swap protocol (no need for 212% for bob side).
3. No need for ETOMIC for ETH/ERC20 swaps.
4. Many other changes in codebase: less C, more Rust.

Then we add the UTXO as input to spending transaction until we collect required output amount: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/blob/mm2-coins/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L193. This way we're eager to `merge`utxos instead of split, the address can have single UTXO and trade without additional actions.";"";"👍 (6),🤘 (2),shexy (1)";

Native wallets usually generate new `change` address for this purpose, but it's not possible in MM for now.";"";"";
