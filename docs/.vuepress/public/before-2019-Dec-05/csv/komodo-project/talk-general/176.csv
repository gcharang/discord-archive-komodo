I'm sure JL777 for instance does design and also coding, which is great. Some only do coding and don't design. I'm more interested in the design than how to make it happen. For instance, I'd rather be an architect than a construction worker, or a director rather than an actor. Coding is fun for some people and not fun for others, same with construction and acting. That's fine, we should all do things we like. I'm not criticizing coding at all, each type of work contributes to the overall project.";"";"";

As @grewalsatinder said, literally everything is related to math in some way. Math is like the 1s and 0s in computing. It doesn't mean you need to know how the 1s and 0s work in order to code. In the same way, I don't need to know every tiny technical aspect in order to contribute. Even in math there is informal and formal math. I recommend the movie ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" about Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (yes I had to copy-paste it), but his wiki is a good summary: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan

`Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: ""He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered"". [...] However, [...] in his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy stated had ""defeated [him and his colleagues] completely"", in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.`

`Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him.`

Ramanujan wasn't big on formally proving his work, even though a lot of it was formally proved in the end. What's my point? Some people like formal work, such as accounting, and other people like informal work, like art, while still others like both. Nothing wrong with it, and we need both types of work. Too much formality is too time and energy intensive, while too much informality leads to mistakes and faulty assumptions.";"";"";

I agree it is like a novel. Only, what I don't find fun about programming is how how ""picky"" the readers are, resulting in a bad story. As you say, the syntax has to be 100% correct. Most natural language is informal and subjective, yet people understand most of what you say. This can be good and bad, as stated above. A lot, if not most, human disagreement I believe is due to us not using some type of formal language to get our points across, however getting those points across would be very very tiresome.

Programming languages right now are too formal for me to like it. As time goes on, these languages will most likely become more and more informal to the point where natural language can be translated to code more efficiently and accurately. It can never be as efficient as lower level languages, and it will take work, but it will get better as time goes on I assume. 

At some point I may enjoy coding, when I don't have to make sure every little thing is in its proper place in order for it to compile, which drives me nuts. I don't have the patience for it. When I write, all I have to think about is how to structure an article in a way that makes sense to the reader.  Programming languages at the moment are like *very* picky readers who won't even read what I wrote unless my sentences are structured in a certain way. Or to an artist it would be like if colors could only be in certain geometric patterns or something. It can't be an estimate of what ""looks right"" or is subjectively pleasing to the eyes, but a set of rules the art must abide by. I could never write or create art like that, personally.";"";"";
"199111383504125952";"garbonzo607#4659";"15-Jan-19 02:57 PM";"Human subjective thought is probably the most informal experience we have, and it's really what I enjoy most. Then there are lower levels of expression that get more and more and more formal, which I find less and less and less fun.

As another example, people who play video games have different difficulty thresholds for maximum enjoyment. For some it is low and find games like Dark Souls too difficult to be fun, while other strive off of the difficulty. Some push themselves to the max and enjoy personal feats such as climbing Everest, while others wouldn't find that pursuit worthwhile. I feel these differences are very similar to what I'm talking about with formality vs. informality.

Does that help explain where I'm coming from? ❤️";"";"";

I'm talking about the literal lowest level binary code most developers don't need to concern themselves with. I used this as an analogy for different levels of formality in life in general. Like I said, I don't find coding fulfilling, nothing wrong with that, but I don't believe it means I can't contribute on a higher level language above programming. Just like Mr. Ramanujan, it just means I can't formally prove anything past a certain point.";"";"";
