A clear and precise outline of what it is that KMD exactly does or wants to do is more helpful IMO. The more precise, the better. If you want to highlight everything it can do, it becomes a little overwhelming and detracts from the appeal, imo it would be better to concentrate on 3 or 4 core points where it excels and outshines others. Besides this effort it can always be helpful to explain in detail every feature (separately), just not everything in one go. Just my 2 cents.";"";"";

The votings on Twitter (or other Plattform)...

And the Best : the community of kmd, who cant speak/write well english (like me) , could post the pictures about KMD too, because we cant make any failures by writing :) 

I think many people are feared about make writing mistakes... But with pictures... Could be easyier... And the voter from other Plattform see the Posted Marketing pictures too.
