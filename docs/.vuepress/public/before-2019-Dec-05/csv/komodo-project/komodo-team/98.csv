This should include access to the legal documentation stating KMD is not a security (Howey Test), and also an explanation (preferably by legal professional), as well as linking Money Transmitter regulations, stating that AtomicDEX does not fall into Money Transmitter category.

These are important for comforting investors of KMD to make sure they can stay compliant if need be, as well as opening up KMD to others. It also gives gives businesses or other projects comfort to build on Atomicdex.

If you for example start your own project using Komodo tech, instead of creating a token on top of KMD's main chain unlike Ethereum's ERC20 tokens, you are actually using the Komodo's daemon `komodod` to start your very own blockchain with few blockchain parameters including it's name, supply, consensus and many other configurable params, which gives you full control on it.";"";"";

just a suggestion- 
https://crypto1xbit.com/en/
seems like a new generation crypto casino, maybe they could be interested in using KMD platform tech?
very much screams BET and CHIPS at me...
last time I checked online casinos for crypto use, nothing like this was on the market, like 3 years ago or so,  BTC usage looked mostly like a grudging and sloppy add-on, but these guys seem to have fully embraced crypto
ofc all centralized and all that- but that is status of industry now
so if they are really innovative and proactive, maybe they see the advantage of a truly decentralized casino platform and start looking at KMD platform tech and maybe implement it ?
How about just reaching out to them and try to start a conversation with them?
KMD has the tech, but not the capabilities to be an online casino (like creating GUIs etc)
