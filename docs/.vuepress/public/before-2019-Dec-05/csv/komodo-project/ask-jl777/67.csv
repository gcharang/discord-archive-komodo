I have a frustration, and I will ask again.

Since December 10, 2017, Agama has been loaded and has been dead.
At that time, I did not even know there was a wallet.dat file and just formatted it.

After installing new Acama purse, the KMD coin in my Agama purse is missing.
After that, the transaction history file after December 6, 2017 disappears. The transaction history for about 5 days should not appear at all.
At about 97.3%, it disappears from the last step.

The agama version used at that time is 23a. In previous versions, to get the interest, you had to do it manually (that is, when you send it from my agama to my wallet bitlex and then send it back to the agama)
However, the 23a version did not send it out, but the button was automatically pressed to add interest.

I've had a lot of chats here (https://komodo-platform.slack.com/), but all the chats are gone.

And while he was chatting, he told me:
""There are over 126,000 missing coins at any address.""
I asked them if they could find out which address they were in, and they said they could not do it because they were a private company.

At the time, the only thing they said was that there was no way to recover wallet.dat.
I tried to recover the SSD from then, but I still can not recover it.

here ,
One of @Nabob, @PTY or me @ tarun.gulati admitted that version 23a had a lot of problems.";"";"";
