In 1976, Knuth prepared a second edition of Volume 2, requiring it to be typeset again, but the style of type used in the first edition (called hot type) was no longer available.

Object oriented programming just resides on three thingies: inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. C++/Java/C# are pretty much as object oriented as you can get, and not even close to the Alan Kay school of abjekts evvawheewhaa. The languages that belong in that mindset are Python and Ruby.
