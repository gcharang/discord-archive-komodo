It also seems like an inordinate amount of posts are just people complaining. Constructive criticism ie ""I think X is a little weak, we should try Y to make X better"" is a lot better than ""kmd is a total shitcoin and your team sucks"". People often just come in here to troll everyone and there should be some threshold where people who are being dicks will be muted or kicked, even temporarily. No one needs it. It just lowers morale.
