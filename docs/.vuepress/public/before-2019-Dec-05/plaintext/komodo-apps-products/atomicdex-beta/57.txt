yes, amount should be above 0.00777 @Voight

[06-Sep-19 07:02 PM] jansako#3330
Correct me if I am wrong, but currently there is no way of seeing the order book for a coin that the user already does to have a balance in their wallet.
In a way it is logical, but I would want to know the price before I send any to my DEX wallet... 

In other words, this is a feature request: Show order books for coins with 0 balance.

this is a dumb question but all the swaps on this public beta are real swaps right? not a testnet

[06-Sep-19 07:43 PM] gcharang#6833
rick - morty pair are the test coins
the rest of the pairs are real trades between real coins involving their blockchains

[06-Sep-19 07:47 PM] ca333#0118
even Rick and Morty trades are **real** swaps - this is a production/live DEX network. No testnet. However, still considered beta-stage.

[06-Sep-19 07:58 PM] gigamesh#3544
how many years this been in development?

[06-Sep-19 07:59 PM] gigamesh#3544
before this there was public beta signup - how long was that going on for?

thx for any replies

[06-Sep-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a document with detailed timeline, basically started around 2014, so 5+ years

[06-Sep-19 08:06 PM] ca333#0118
@gigamesh - Komodo's DEX technology has been in development for half a decade like stated above -  AtomicDEX is our 3rd generation DEX technology which was eventually ported from the legacy codebase and tech-stack to the new protocol and state of the art tech-stack. The closed beta was going on for around 2 months before reaching public beta stage.

@marrych it needs some addional research and work to implent (special swap smart contract for ETC needs to be created). In general I think it's possible but not in the shortlist at the moment

With enabled PIN protection it should start fine. And in general I'm strongly recommend to always use this option 🙂  But anyway it'll be fixed for sure

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #82: Total asset display
1. Swap needs to finish until step 3. (ex. ETH to KMD)
2. Go back to PORTFOLIO total assets displayed in USD
3. The total USD value displays the PREVIOUS USD value PLUS the swapped asset which was not yet confirmed.

suggestion: after any swap (step 3) wait for ALL transactions to be confirmed before computing for total USD value

The server is is on has been having memory issues lately tho, so it might crash intermittently (auto revive is in effect). Hoping to upgrade or move some things to another server next week.

[07-Sep-19 08:50 AM] groundhog#0062
Do ricks only swap for mortys btw?

[07-Sep-19 08:51 AM] groundhog#0062
Or can i swap a rick for anything?

[07-Sep-19 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
No, technically you can swap RICK/MORTY with any asset but it has not much sense for buyer because RICK and MORTY valuation is 0$

[07-Sep-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please record a short screencast with your problem (you can use AZ screenrecorder for example) and DM me?

I install the AtomicDEX on my xiaomi mobile (with Android 7.1.1 with the Miui 10.3.1 Version) - - > dont work (connection Problem) after that, I install the AtomicDEX on my old mobile (casper, Android 5.1) and IT works GREAT!!!

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #89 Support Coinomi seedphrases
A colleague attempted to use a Coinomi seedphrase and while it was seen as valid, no BTC balance was seen.

I wonder if this is actually a bug in "gap addresses" and not checking enough addresses for a balance, or genuinely looking at a wrong wallet prefix.

In any case, it would be amazing for AtomicDEX if all existing Coinomi users could sweep their funds away from a closed source wallet 🎉
