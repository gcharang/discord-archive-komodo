[16-Jul-19 06:07 AM] TonyL#3577

In this video we can see two issues
First we can see that the conversion to USD is totally broken
Second, I just can't create an order for LTCRFOX. I've noticed this issues with some others currencies as well.

You tipped @nymkappa **9.9999 ARRR**
A network fee of 0.0001 ARRR was deducted from the amount.
This operation is pending. You will be notified when when it has finished.

I guess when we will have nSPV library made and that utilized in markermaker and with AtomicDEX mobile tor enabled atomic swaps will be even more quickest 🤔 just thinking

@TonyL @Mylo is it ready to test a swap with BTC?

[16-Jul-19 06:23 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, swap with BTC should work

[16-Jul-19 06:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I sent 100 NZD worth btc to it's wallet

[16-Jul-19 06:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Which pairs should I test with BTC?

[16-Jul-19 06:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried USDC and KMD

[16-Jul-19 06:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BTC/ETH?

[16-Jul-19 06:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Are there orders?

[16-Jul-19 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I don't think that there is any liquidity for BTC atm

[16-Jul-19 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Bricked my app so can't check atm 😃

[16-Jul-19 06:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmm.... I can't see orderbook. So which pairs have liquidity with BTC?

It is amazing. Sent tor enabled btc wallet funds to tor enabled atomicdex. And then would be able to trade those funds totally decentralized atomic swaps! Feeling very very :abusedsmily: right now

[16-Jul-19 06:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So do I make an ask by selling btc and buying kmd?

[16-Jul-19 06:32 AM] cipi#4502
selling BTC for KMD... for the above orderbook

[16-Jul-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Cool
Will do that

[16-Jul-19 06:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't have KMD access from mobile at all

[16-Jul-19 06:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If I for example make an order of 2000, and the bids says maxvolume 500 or 600 as showing in that JSON will that make the matching utxos and fill my order from seller side?

[16-Jul-19 06:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Alright! M ready for some BTC atomic swaps over tor

[16-Jul-19 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
ouch, you need some more BTC

[16-Jul-19 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
minimal amount from both sides is 0.0077 any coin

[16-Jul-19 06:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hmmm ok

[16-Jul-19 06:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Glad I posted here before starting

[16-Jul-19 06:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok sent 0.03 to atomicdex wallet

[16-Jul-19 06:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will wait for that to confirm

[16-Jul-19 06:41 AM] TonyL#3577
`If I for example make an order of 2000, and the bids says maxvolume 500 or 600 as showing in that JSON will that make the matching utxos and fill my order from seller side?` in general it should create `taker` request first, then if it match existing `maker` request it should partially fill it and part which left convert to `maker` request

[16-Jul-19 06:42 AM] TonyL#3577
```Buy and sell methods always create the taker order first. Therefore, you must pay an additional 1/777 fee of the trade amount during the swap when taking liquidity from the market. If your order is not matched in 30 seconds, the order is automatically converted to a maker request and stays on the orderbook until the request is matched or cancelled. To always act as a maker, please use the setprice method.```

[16-Jul-19 06:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok, will resume this test later
Wife back from shopping,  again.... 😅

Right now it shows 0 amount coins on top and coins with amount later in list

9 mins for swap between coins of komodo eco system? Man thats too long. At least it must be fast between komodo tokens

[16-Jul-19 07:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
it's based on blocktimes

[16-Jul-19 07:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
on ondemand chains it will be very very fast

@CHMEX ondemand channel? Second layer solution?

[16-Jul-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a lot faster than any other tor based atomic swap

[16-Jul-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it could very well be the first ever atomic swaps over tor, in the world

[16-Jul-19 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Need more market makers maybe.  If 100 ppl decide to do 20+ swaps at same time....we’re not testing that yet

[16-Jul-19 07:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

i guess 0.00777 might be too low... look in your swap files

[16-Jul-19 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I specifically input 0.00777 😅

[16-Jul-19 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Maybe need more than that

[16-Jul-19 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Gonna try bigger then

[16-Jul-19 07:25 AM] cipi#4502
the swap status would indicate exactly how much is needed

[16-Jul-19 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe your bundle is outdated  a little bit @grewalsatinder - soon new build will be published to play market it's better to try with it
