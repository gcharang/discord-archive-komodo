Btw, the name is showing atomicDEX correctly, now

[17-Jul-19 02:22 AM] Tony Stark#4609
Trying to enable all available coins, taking ages also...

[17-Jul-19 02:25 AM] Tony Stark#4609
It got stuck and didn't activate... Returned to the initial screen, adding each coin one by one...

[17-Jul-19 02:37 AM] aka222#2811
Hello friends

[17-Jul-19 02:38 AM] aka222#2811
I've pre registrated for the email for the invite email but still unable to download the app? Am I forgetting something?

[17-Jul-19 02:49 AM] Tony Stark#4609
@SHossain @ca333  our friend @aka222 is having trouble to install the app from the play store...

[17-Jul-19 02:50 AM] Tony Stark#4609
@aka222 please wait the admins help you... I had the same issue yesterday!

[17-Jul-19 03:00 AM] Tony Stark#4609
Doing my first atomic swap... When it says "Don't close the app", I can leave it running in the background, right? Just not kill it in the system task manager?

[17-Jul-19 03:10 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes, you can leave it running in the background. I've done it many times.

[17-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Tony Stark#4609
@yorklab yeah, finished successfully!

[17-Jul-19 03:21 AM] Tony Stark#4609
It was fast... Didn't time it, but took less than 10 min... Is it always this fast? I guess with BTC it won't, right? Say, I wanna swap BTC to BCH (or vice versa), both have 10 min block time, how long will/should it take to complete?

[17-Jul-19 03:26 AM] Tony Stark#4609
I noticed something odd

[17-Jul-19 03:27 AM] Tony Stark#4609
Why is it showing as unconfirmed in one place and confirmed in another one???

[17-Jul-19 03:36 AM] aka222#2811
@Tony Stark thanks mate appreciate the help

[17-Jul-19 03:47 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@aka222 reboot phone, it may update your app store cache

[17-Jul-19 04:11 AM] yorklab#7270
@Tony Stark Mine show unconfirmed also; don't know why.

[17-Jul-19 05:23 AM] tolken#2655
@yorklab do you know if beta for iOS has been confirmed? I’m just not clear if I missed something. I signed up, got accepted, but then I had to give my App Store email. Haven’t heard back since.

[17-Jul-19 05:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Is there an easy way to become liquidity provider at this time?

[17-Jul-19 06:12 AM] artem.pikulin#0794 (pinned)
@PTYX Hi, the process of setting up a LP node (maker) is as follows::
1. Arrange a server/vps.
2. Build/download MM2 (atomicDEX-API) and configure following walkthrough guideline: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html#initiate-marketmaker-2-0
3. Activate the coins you'd like to sell and receive, fill the balance with desired amount.
4. Call `setprice` for selected pairs: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#setprice
5. If you have any questions please feel free to ask at #dev-marketmaker

@aka222 DM me your app store ID 
@Tony Stark `Why is it showing as unconfirmed in one place and confirmed in another one???` - congratz - you found a bug. We will fix that.

[17-Jul-19 08:08 AM] wl#4107
Things I missed: 
- Price in BTC
- The two arrows to swap currencies places do not work
- Max button, when exchanging
- When filling how much you want to trade for automatically puts how much is needed for the desired amount
- Option to remove an added coin from the list
- when hovering between - trade - order - history - it goes smooth, but when actually clicking on them it shows a translucid square...

noted - thanks for the feedback

@wl ps. we have a max. feature - you just type in a bigger number than your current balance (just type in multiple 9s)  and it will automagically take over max_balance. We will add a "button" for it to make it more clear/intuitive.

[17-Jul-19 08:47 AM] ferjr90#9314
@aka222 Follow this link: https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex

[17-Jul-19 08:48 AM] ferjr90#9314
I downloaded the app following that link, from Google Play I couldn't install it

[17-Jul-19 10:03 AM] vogelfreund88#4534
Eth sync really slow...

[17-Jul-19 10:04 AM] Malti#3948
I don't know if it was already mentioned; but when you fill in a wrong pincode it prompts you that it is wrong but you have to manually backspace to re-enter. Would be nicer if it was just autodeleted?

[17-Jul-19 10:15 AM] Malti#3948
damn, swap completed. It goes so easy that you don't realize what amazing tech sits behind it.. it goes a bit slower than I thought when I saw the mock-ups on the site, but ho-lee-fuuk this is nice.

comments/suggestions will follow if any 😃

I posted a tweet in #talk-trading , go there and give it some love if y'all want

[17-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464
How do we download ios app?

[17-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Malti#3948
you will receive a mail

[17-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Markus#5464
i recieved mail but no dl instructions

[17-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Malti#3948
and then you need to download 'testflight' from the app store

[17-Jul-19 10:27 AM] Markus#5464
unless that is just information about what we gonna test

[17-Jul-19 10:27 AM] Markus#5464
idk

[17-Jul-19 10:27 AM] Malti#3948
it's a mail from 'testflight' so once you have testflight on your phone, go back to that mail and click 'view in testfligh'

[17-Jul-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
no such thing in the mail

[17-Jul-19 10:31 AM] Markus#5464
maybe they will send another mail idk

[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Malti#3948
Download TestFlight already anyway

[17-Jul-19 10:42 AM] ca333#0118
@Markus plz DM me your iOS appstore ID

[17-Jul-19 10:58 AM] CMaurice#1685
in the Play Store, searched for aromicDEX, it says I am registered but I don't seem to be provided with an install opportunity, just unregister with a note underneath 'coming soon'

[17-Jul-19 10:58 AM] CMaurice#1685

[17-Jul-19 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, clearing cache helps

[17-Jul-19 11:10 AM] mobipoi#5774

[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, @Audo i see your order

[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007

[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] Audo#5667
I don't have KMD yet

[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] Audo#5667
😉

[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] ca333#0118

[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007

[17-Jul-19 11:22 AM] SHossain#0007

[17-Jul-19 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
step 2/3 💃🏽

[17-Jul-19 11:23 AM] Audo#5667
still step 1 / 3 for me

[17-Jul-19 11:23 AM] Audo#5667
but it's nice, it works, and this really demonstrated the freedom

[17-Jul-19 11:25 AM] Malti#3948
I have 1 swap that is stuck on order matching for a while already 

 a3fbc7bf-8e20-44fe-a589-ddfe4159f736

[17-Jul-19 11:25 AM] Malti#3948
Disclosure: I locked my phone while in this step

[17-Jul-19 11:25 AM] ca333#0118
@Malti - is it on 1/3 ?

[17-Jul-19 11:25 AM] Malti#3948
yes

[17-Jul-19 11:25 AM] ca333#0118
on android?

[17-Jul-19 11:25 AM] Malti#3948
iOS

[17-Jul-19 11:26 AM] ca333#0118
ok - once you reopen it keep it running

[17-Jul-19 11:26 AM] Malti#3948
ok, phone open now

[17-Jul-19 11:26 AM] ca333#0118
on iOS there is a limitatin - unlike android it does NOT swap in the background

[17-Jul-19 11:26 AM] Malti#3948
damn iOS
