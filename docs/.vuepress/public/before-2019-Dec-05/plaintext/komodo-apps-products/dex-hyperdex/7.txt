for XVG and the like check network status and trade in increments

Same risk as with centralized exchange: attack means your funds are in trouble

[25-Jun-18 09:08 PM] mv#8810
Yes

[25-Jun-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no magic

[25-Jun-18 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are swapping a chain that is insecure, then that insecurity becomes part of the process

[25-Jun-18 09:08 PM] dan.#2473
the onus is on the other blockchain

[25-Jun-18 09:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Responsible trades? who does that?
All my trades are lazily scripted 😖

[25-Jun-18 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
you arent trading 50 BTC worth of coins per swap

[25-Jun-18 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, I'm much too cowardly for that

[25-Jun-18 09:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
last time I traded more than a pseudo of $10k the markets jumped the other way and I would have made another $5k the next day

[25-Jun-18 09:16 PM] mv#8810
If we prefer a world of decentralized swaps, then in the long run we do want to be able to handle 50 BTC swaps.  If I'm a car dealer, I want to be able to accept payment in, say, Verge, and deliver the car the same day.  That probably means I have to be able to swap the payment into whatever funds are accepted by the factor who has loaned the money to buy my inventory.

[25-Jun-18 09:20 PM] dan.#2473
The protocol is tight. The only scary thing for me would be waiting for refund if the swap got stuck using large amounts. Even though I've gotten back 100% always.

[25-Jun-18 09:23 PM] dan.#2473
that fact james is throwing around that much vol means he trusts it too 😉

[25-Jun-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've had to go back through some of my old testing swaps to get refunds, but I've never not gotten back 1/2 of the trade; be it my 1/2 or the 1/2 I wanted, I've always gotten a right amount 😃

[25-Jun-18 09:25 PM] dan.#2473
yeah, ditto, i forget the date, sometime in march, but anything pre march i had to double check my old swaps

[25-Jun-18 09:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and if you get a lucky bid war, yu get more than you want

[25-Jun-18 09:25 PM] dan.#2473
but i did a few thousand after then, and was perfect

[25-Jun-18 09:26 PM] dan.#2473
pre march i had to use params w/ swapstatus as the list file didnt have everything

[26-Jun-18 03:34 AM] proto#5912
Hey guys, i remember long ago mention about pegged assets in barterdex, is it still a planned thing ?

[26-Jun-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they were removed

[26-Jun-18 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it was an early feature of KMD.

[26-Jun-18 03:48 AM] proto#5912
Ah ok

[26-Jun-18 04:42 AM] Jcharming#2693
Is the hyperdex available to use for trading assets other than BEER and PIZZA yet or does the Barterdex still need to be used at this time?

[26-Jun-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> you can use hyperdex

[26-Jun-18 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> not sure if BEER/PIZZA are even working atm, as I took my bobs down, I ran out of money on my VPS account for the month

[26-Jun-18 04:45 AM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks, is there a guide or tutorial for trading on hyperdex that you'd recommend I check out?

[26-Jun-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not sure, but its pretty easy compared to barterdex

[26-Jun-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Just make a deposit and be patient, blockchains can be slow to confirm.

[26-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks for the update @blackjok3r do you know what the latest hypdex release version is?

there was some recent updates to marketmaker back end, as far as I know they are not in HyperDEX so it might not function 100%.

[26-Jun-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant lose any funds tho, if trade fails you just need to wait 4h.

[26-Jun-18 04:59 AM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks for the update!   I have to swing by #deleted-channel first I just updated to 2.4 beta and I"m getting a connection error starting in lite mode I figure someone will know there.

are btc network fees really like 6 dollars right now or is hyperDEX estimating wrong

there's some single input transactions in that block that were a pseudo of $20

what a joke

[26-Jun-18 05:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but the mempool is empty

[26-Jun-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe miners are trying to recoupe losses by chargeing more fees 🤔

[26-Jun-18 05:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure I count 1500 as "empty"

[26-Jun-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well in scaling test the 64 chains are  1.5GB of mempool

[26-Jun-18 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
clears in 20mins 😛

[26-Jun-18 05:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
all high BTC fees are voluntary

[26-Jun-18 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
welll the nature of competition mining should dictate that if you put a super low fee and the mempool is empty (or not full) that someone would mine it for you... unless all miners are in collusion... then we all fucked.

[26-Jun-18 05:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
exactly. now, couple that with the fact that Bitcoin was never supposed to have fees for most use cases and only fees for large data transactions

[26-Jun-18 05:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the insanity of fees started with the 100k spam tx war over segwit/bigger-blocks

[26-Jun-18 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it got to 200k there for a while... I wonder if anyone was using something like TxBlaster to spam it... I think thats doubtful, becasues they could have got it to millions of TX deep using that without much effort.

[26-Jun-18 02:53 PM] TomiDCat#6017
do we have the option to send with a lower fee?

[26-Jun-18 03:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
No

[26-Jun-18 03:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
we just use the fee supplied by `marketmaker`

[26-Jun-18 03:17 PM] TomiDCat#6017
seems excessively high

[26-Jun-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
every reason to not use Shitcoin

[26-Jun-18 03:18 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
*bitcoin

[26-Jun-18 03:19 PM] TomiDCat#6017
cost 1.91 to send from agama which confirmed under 10 mins then 20 minutes later hyperdex is asking for 6 dollars for tx fee

[26-Jun-18 03:19 PM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX doesn't have anything to do with the fee calculations, it's all handled by the `marketmaker` daemon

[26-Jun-18 03:20 PM] TomiDCat#6017
understood

[26-Jun-18 03:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) stop thinking of BTC fees in pseudo USD
2) blame Core devs, they created the estimatefee algorithm

[26-Jun-18 03:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX seeds are compatible with Agama, so you could import it and send from there to get around it for now

[26-Jun-18 03:22 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Okay but point being fees are higher than necessary regardless of semantics

[26-Jun-18 03:23 PM] TomiDCat#6017
@lukechilds thanks I can try that. Just trying to create UTXOs so I can get a swap to go through

[26-Jun-18 03:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Again, that's something you need to take up with the coin devs (Core created this by design)

[26-Jun-18 03:25 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Ok but why is Agama able to estimate fees that are much lower?

[26-Jun-18 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Agama uses a flat fee and marketmaker uses a live fee to speed trades
different tools, different functions, different needs

[26-Jun-18 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
When you send BTC as a currency, it matters less if it sits a block or 3.
When you trade BTC as a commodity, no one wants to wait an hr for a trade to complete.

[26-Jun-18 03:30 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Doing a manual withdrawal needs to use speed trading why?

[26-Jun-18 03:31 PM] TomiDCat#6017
I understand the need for speed when trading within hyperdex but I am just trying to create UTXOs I have no issue waiting 5-10 minutes

[26-Jun-18 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's key to understand that DEX isn't meant to be a wallet, and there are no "withdraws"

[26-Jun-18 03:33 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Not going to pretend to be smart enough to understand the complexities of all of this but it seems like we are blaming core devs while we are using the wrong tool for the job

[26-Jun-18 03:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The point is to allow you to use funds from your private wallet to freely trade for some other CoinX
Use your wallet for wallet things and DEX for trade things and you'll be golden

[26-Jun-18 03:34 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Not trying to be combative here

[26-Jun-18 03:35 PM] TomiDCat#6017
But creating UTXOs is something unique and new to me

[26-Jun-18 03:36 PM] TomiDCat#6017
When I have to mess around sending stuff back and forth to try and get a swap to go through I dont want to be paying excessive fees

[26-Jun-18 03:37 PM] TomiDCat#6017
I didnt think to try and use Agama to send to myself though so that is a way I can try that to bypass the fees

[26-Jun-18 03:39 PM] TomiDCat#6017
In the name of user friendly experience it seems like it would be possible to give them the option of using a lower fee if time is not important for a manual withdrawal

[26-Jun-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"it seems like we are blaming core devs while we are using the wrong tool for the job"
No, I'm placing "blame" estimate fee code on Core, because they wrote it. You asked why the fee is "high" and I responded specifically as to the difference.
Any wallet tools in DEX are meant for convenience and most coins don't suffer such an issue because their devs didn't code it to economically scale profits for miners.

[26-Jun-18 03:41 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Ok I accept your answer as being truthful as well, just wondering if it cannot be better

[26-Jun-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"In the name of user friendly experience it seems like it would be possible to give them the option of using a lower fee if time is not important for a manual withdrawal"
The short truth is that marketmaker uses the same code for both; however, I'm sure that devs would welcome anyone writing a separate, low-fee routine for manual transfers...

[26-Jun-18 03:45 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Ya I think that was the answer I was looking for

[26-Jun-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
"txfee" field can be passed into the marketmaker withdraw api

[26-Jun-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt, for BTC, mm calculates what should get confirmed in a block or two as that is needed for following the atomic swap protocol

[26-Jun-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
not using the "txfee" field and letting m use the BTC stupidestimatefee api, well it is what it is

How do I view private keys?

[28-Jun-18 01:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Cypher Dev Tools still show because it's still in alpha. The error is because `marketmaker` crashed, unrelated to the GUI.

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Cypher#9999
sure

[28-Jun-18 01:30 PM] Cypher#9999
however what is the first error

[28-Jun-18 01:31 PM] Cypher#9999
unhandled promise rejection

[28-Jun-18 01:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
Hmmn, do you get it repeatedly or was it a one off?

[28-Jun-18 01:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
also, can you go to `Debug > Show app data` and paste the contents of `config.json`
