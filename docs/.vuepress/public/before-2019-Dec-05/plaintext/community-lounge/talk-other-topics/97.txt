Bitcoin prices soared in June due to the liberalization of Hong Kong. 
Although media outlets say bitcoin rises and falls according to events without actual demand, the reason why bitcoin has grown so much is because it is actually useful.

Hong Kongers, concerned that China's control will be tightened, have no choice but to contemplate moving abroad, but they cannot avoid plunging asset prices if they dispose of their assets only at an imminent date. In many cases, disposal of assets does not have the means to carry them out. 
There is nothing like Bitcoin as an easy asset to move abroad. 
If the U.S.-China trade war intensifies further, China will try to control foreign exchange. 
When foreign companies in China want to dispose of their assets and move them to foreign countries, one can think of a case in which the Chinese government won't convert them into foreign money. 
China is the country where bitcoin is mined the most. If assets are converted to bitcoin, there is no difficulty in moving capital abroad even if the Chinese government controls foreign exchange.

[28-Jun-19 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`due to the liberalization of Hong Kong. `
yes, I'm sure that's the reason

[28-Jun-19 02:24 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Aside from the validity of your statement, your reasoning goes in the opposite direction: due to the **de**liberalization of Hong Kong the prices soar.... (Hong Kong companies transferring their assets into BTC, to prepare to leave Hong Kong, due to the thread of intensified Chinese control)
