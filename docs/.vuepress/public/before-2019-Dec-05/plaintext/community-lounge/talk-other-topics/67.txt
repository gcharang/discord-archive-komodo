people have to make a clear difference between melted magma that is just plain and living things....even now Japanese people do experiments with water and water seem to be in some way reacting with the environment with the sound of voices.

[02-Apr-19 04:02 PM] Hermes#6934
but nobody has said water is alive

[02-Apr-19 04:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Voices = sound waves => water can be a carrier of these waves

It has yet to be seen a volcano provoking  a pattern of intelligent golden ratio or any type of intelligent pattern

Energies must flow between the human, animal, plant, mineral, and the cosmic. Following these ideals creates agriculture that is, as far as possible, self-supporting.

I recently had a discussion with a Venezuelan woman who is married to a multimillionaire.

I asked her, “What are people doing to buy food down there in Venezuela? Do people use Bitcoin?” 

She then responded saying, “No, not really. The government made it illegal to use cryptocurrency... But I have some family that tried to sell their house with Fake Bitcoin, and so I asked my husband to look into it, and he saved them from selling the house in return for Fake Bitcoin.”

I said, “Wow that’s crazy.” And took a nice little mental note lol

My feeling afterward was that legacy playaz (“Playaz” being the $100m+ crowd) are very aware of the space, and likely more aware than we think 🤙

@Lumbi Random thought on your NN randomness thought process (and continuing with my NN(A) using 5GHz and NN(B) using 3.9GHz example):
I during a given round of PoW, NN(B) would have found a block, but your influence decided that NN(A) was the only one allowed to find a block, then you've actively harmed the one you sought to protect by manipulating the outcome. 🤔

NN PoW under preferred terms is understandable, although I wonder if faster NNs make more than slow NNs or if the ping would lead to discrepancies in renumeration, but I was thinking more along the lines of the second, actual dPoW notary process and whether or not a faster notary would be able to dominate the number of notarizations with superior hardware and whether or not that could be considered hazardous from the standpoint of even distribution (i.e better practical security).

Would have not needed to do a whole lot of world things I did and again came back to this same language

I'd give 99% of all I have to go back in time and learn C/C++ when I had time, patience, and mental acuity instead of learning VB

not sure I see a 25% slower speed as "just a little slower" 🤷🏽

you really think you can code the same algo in JS that is within 25% of the speed I code the C version in?

C can be much more performant

.229×100 =22.9
22.9÷.183=125.1366
=
25.1366% slower
because, math

I doubt JS can reach 50% the speed of a well written native C
