The Doge to Ether bridge created a lot of excitement in the @dogecoin community. But @ummjackson has doubts about the usefulness of moving Doge into @Ethereum and thinks there is little benefit to end users.

if there was any doubt as to the legitimacy of VBK, it seems now there are very few hopes of it being valid

the account that accused Dukeleto has tweeted about that Paypal story since early march, she probably jumped on the occasion when she saw him tagged. The others took the occasion not to answer his question and troll in turn

[01-Apr-19 07:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I see the story is reported in many local news articles, it doesn't seem a scam. Not sure if it's our Leto or another one and it's not important. But Paypal also said to ask the bank for a refund and the story should have an happy ending

Just coincidance... or optical illusion I wonder... Surly it couldnt be an actaul dragon the size of a country 🤔

[02-Apr-19 08:51 AM] Hermes#6934
It would be funny that the reason why people can't explore Antartica is because  of a giant animal that hasn't decomposed ...and I think that there is real possibility of an animal of that size.

Basically this guy is telling you that unusual rock formations that look like tissue...or have a type of color were part of an organ or even an organ  and things that people think are  underground "created by nature" tunnels ...are basically veins and arteries  of giant animals or humans

basically thinking that certain formations of rocks were part of tissue or an organ of a bigger animal is not something that people normally do everyday...but when I see that carbon can make an animal live twice it's lifespan ....I start paying attention to minerals lol

Where is the proof that there were dragons the size of countries?

[02-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If that big there must be some?

[02-Apr-19 01:01 PM] Hermes#6934
I think that first part of the thing is analyzing the video... but not only that one that he is showing... in the next videos... he will present you the case of giant organs or tissues ....that according to his theory are not rock formations but tissue that has been petrified into mineral

[02-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Hermes#6934
more or less as the Silicon Trees...near Silicon Valley ....petrified wood that converted into minerals

[02-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Hermes#6934
If you keep watching the videos....you will see the theory of how gold is made....basically gold is blood that exploded from the veins or arteries when one of this giant animals died...and stayed as gold... remember that inside of us....we create transition metals.... when we die there is possibility depending on the environment that our bodies transform into certain minerals.

Even if a substance changes chemically, it can't change one type of atom (carbon for example) into another.

[02-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Isotopes may be an exception to the rule as they are theoretically different atoms

[02-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe through fusion it's possible

Remote Vision is the key ...but you have to do it the right way...if not you can end up in a very bad dream...

[02-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So like astral projection/scrying?

[02-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or actual seeing current events remotely

[02-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Hermes#6934
people first  travel in astral projection... but they are actual people investing into remote vision ...to solve puzzles or to enter a places without going physically in there.

[02-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Hermes#6934
the thing about rocks...is that rocks are not living things... they shouldn't  make an intelligent pattern and formations that came from volcanoes explosion don't make any type of pattern....
