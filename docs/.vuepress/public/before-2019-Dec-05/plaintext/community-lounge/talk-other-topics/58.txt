that “something” should be done to prevent a lot of human issues in the future but no real answers

[03-Mar-19 03:37 PM] gt#2812

`people aren’t really sure exactly what’s happening`
That's literally how it all began, with a paper that said "we don't *know* what else it could be", and absent any meaningful discoveries it became "we are certain it's this"

[03-Mar-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181

[03-Mar-19 03:40 PM] gt#2812
who’s “we”

[03-Mar-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
we know this as fact

[03-Mar-19 03:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and any one that is alive clearly can see that the sun effects climate... is it hotter in the day time?

`who’s “we”`
I forget the names of the authors of the original paper, but "we" was part of the paper's conclusion
The modern "we" is those in support of the claim that AGW is both significant and detrimental

If you want to  call me out on math, sure, I've never "actually done any of my own math" when it comes to climate science, but, for that criticism to be legit, anyone wielding it should put up and show me the math they've done.  If you want to have a conversation about epistemology especially as regards this topic, I'd be happy to engage.  Actually talking about the science, with the pretense that my questions are substantial, I will not engage.   Would be like two 3 year old's discussing  mortgage rates.  As far as my joke about making me wonder if crypto has any hope, take it as a joke.

if that fatal flaw video is correct and solar flare energy is not in the climate models, it sure seems like a pretty big missing data especially as recent decades have had an increase in solar flares

[03-Mar-19 06:12 PM] peritonlogon#7708
It's funny that this is the pinned comment on the video 

"Please note: 0% of existing climate studies may be used to debunk this video... by definition.﻿"

[03-Mar-19 06:17 PM] peritonlogon#7708
Who is "that scientist" even?  He doesn't introduce himself in the beginning of the video and there's no name pinned to it.  Someone in the comments calls him Ben.

[03-Mar-19 06:22 PM] jl777c#5810
does it matter who it is? is what he is saying true? that solar flares effect is categorized as human caused?

[03-Mar-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
just because someone has "credentials" doesnt automatically make him correct and just because somebody doesnt have "credentials" doesnt make them incorrect.

[03-Mar-19 06:23 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are correct, they are correct, regardless of their "credentials"

[03-Mar-19 06:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so, the key question is what data do the climate models just ignore and by default it is categorized as human caused

[03-Mar-19 06:35 PM] peritonlogon#7708
No, but when it comes to me knowing next to nothing about a decades long field of research I'm inclined to defer my opinion.  In reality, since none of us are tabulating this guy's data or reading geophysics journals, we actually know very little about what he's talking about, either of the models or his criticism.  Our actual opinions on the matter, in this discord, divide not along lines of scientific understanding or logical argument, but along political lines, or, in other words, along tribal lines.

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so nobody can answer whether solar flares energy is counted as human contribution or no?

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] peritonlogon#7708
not me

[03-Mar-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
until that is answered, I think we need to pause any debate as the answer to that would seem to determine the answer

[03-Mar-19 06:40 PM] jl777c#5810
solar flares can be very energetic

[03-Mar-19 06:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so if we can confirm an increase of solar flares in recent decades and also that this energy is not accounted for in the climate models, then it seems the current global warming isnt caused by humans

solar energy is 2500x more than all other energy sources combined. if that is true, then even very small percentage changes in solar output seems to have a very big effect

[03-Mar-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so whatever the effect of the solar radiation is, i would think needs to be fully accounted for to measure whether humans are significantly affecting global temps. not even sure this is possible if solar energy is 2500x more than all else combined

[03-Mar-19 06:49 PM] peritonlogon#7708
I would have to assume that solar variation is included in current models since http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/09/the-trouble-with-sunspots/  But I think retention of heat is actually bigger than quantity of heat, but I'm not a climate scientist

solar flares are not a predictable thing, so i can see how it wouldnt be part of a climate model other than some average value

[03-Mar-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so let us find the answers to the critical questions about the solar flares (among other things) raised in that video. if it is true, then making any conclusion about human influence on global temps seems quite extraordinary

[03-Mar-19 06:59 PM] peritonlogon#7708
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sun-spots-and-climate-change/  According to the second to last paragraph sun variability is included is current IPCC models 

"Peter Foukal of the Massachusetts-based firm Heliophysics, Inc., who has tracked sunspot intensities from different spots around the globe dating back four centuries, also concludes that such solar disturbances have little or no impact on global warming. Nevertheless, he adds, most up-to-date climate models—including those used by the United Nations’ prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—incorporate the effects of the sun’s variable degree of brightness in their overall calculations."

[03-Mar-19 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
"sun’s variable degree of brightness" is NOT solar flares

[03-Mar-19 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what bothers me, a lot of the rhetoric around this issue is not clear and written in a way to influence the conclusion. If they dont have solar flare data, then why not just say what data is and isnt included, instead of saying things like the "variable degree of brightness" is accounted for and pretending that includes all the factors

[03-Mar-19 07:05 PM] peritonlogon#7708
Funny, this is the last paragraph of that article 
"Ironically, the only way to really find out if phenomena like sunspots and solar wind are playing a larger role in climate change than most scientists now believe would be to significantly reduce our carbon emissions. Only in the absence of that potential driver will researchers be able to tell for sure how much impact natural influences have on the Earth’s climate."

[03-Mar-19 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
its only 10^25th power joules of energy, no idea how much that is, but that is a lot of zeroes in a big number

[03-Mar-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
10000000000000000000000000 joules from a single solar flare is possible

[03-Mar-19 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont even fit in a 64 bit number

[03-Mar-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001 watts per square meter, across the entire earth

[03-Mar-19 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact they are saying they dont know the impact of such things in isolation seems to indicate their model is not able to properly account for it.

[03-Mar-19 07:11 PM] jl777c#5810
as if their model properly accounted for it, then it would not be needed to go back to lower carbon emissions to know the impact. so this supports the position of the fatal flaw video that not all the relevant data is in the model and the missing data is attributed to being caused by humans

[03-Mar-19 07:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so we are supposed to believe in climate models that dont know the actual impact of solar radiations on climate, yet based on this incredible amounts of resources are being spent to solve the boogyman of co2

Power was religiousized to make the nation believe that the original record had existed and there were no errors in its judgment. 
If a decentralized system, rather than an authoritative third party, confirms the original nature of the records, the nation's authority will lose much of its legitimacy.

the challenge to the monetary monopoly of the country is only the beginning. If we can confirm that the record is original without the intervention of the authorities, the basis of civilization changes.

If you deny this, it is one of the two. 
Whether it's a white lie worrying about the changing upheavals or blindly following the good will of the elites.

Bitcoin will sway existing authority. 
Do you trust the elites or do you look to the future?
You have to choose.
