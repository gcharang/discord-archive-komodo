it seems the stablecoins will be the gateway to the real crypto

[21-Mar-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
with the economics of stable coins, it seems there will be a lot of issuers of them as they get what is essentially an interest free loan, which they can collect interest on. who wouldnt like that

maybe crypto gets to 1 trillion marketcap with stable coins being the majority of the value

[21-Mar-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
what if some big bank issues 100 billion of a stablecoin, does that make it the #1 marketcap crypto? using current methods CMC uses, it would

[21-Mar-19 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so this is why I predict BTC share of crypto marketcap will go from 50% down to 25% and we wont ever see any dominant crypto at 80%+ ever again

[21-Mar-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
what if we end up with 10 such stablecoins and BTC ends up at #7?

[21-Mar-19 09:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
the irony is that early cypherpunk visions for e-money was more similar to a stablecoin than free-exchange rate BTC

It will indeed become the gateway to crypto and also enable the usability of crypto in developing countries

`as we go from thousands to hundreds of thousands of cryptos, the top ones will grow vs USD, but shrink as percentage of overall crypto`
summary of the chat. 😮

[22-Mar-19 12:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with enough knowledge of the subject and the things influencing this subject one can estimate the future of that subject to some certain amount of time.

1) Mixing?  Disadvantages: The input is conspicuous/traceable. Who mixes is tracked. Expensive.
2) Central mixing service? Who has confidence in it? Money can be stolen. If this service also logs, you are deanonymised. 
Both are striking: You now know that the previous owner has about the same amount of coins from mixing. 
3) Coinjoin: Thanks to different outputs it is very difficult to trace which coin comes from where. 
But if you take a closer look, you will notice that the same sum corresponds to the input.

Wasabi solution: 
1) Blind "Schnorr signature".  (Signing procedure for the exit of the Anonymized Coins so that nobody knows its destination address) 
2) Before any activity occurs on the network, everything is encrypted using Tor. 
3) Zerolink. So-called denomination with anonymity set´s. Default: 50.

helping somebody with the software engineering project report.
All I understand that the writing was more of a problem, and complains about the team the person was part of and lesser about the software

[23-Mar-19 12:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
🤦

[23-Mar-19 12:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Such a waste of Uni student's life writing and understanding about something which is lesser the importance than actual coding skills.

[23-Mar-19 12:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If this is how the Universities teach in New Zealand, they are crap. I don't suggest anyone come to study in New Zealand Unis.

[23-Mar-19 12:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Better just study from online courses and acquire the skills that matter to you.

[23-Mar-19 01:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Universally, unis are designed to promote anything but external utility (meaning that the best thing you can do with a uni education is work at a uni)

[23-Mar-19 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
obviously there are exceptions, but on whole that's their function

[23-Mar-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm surprised the Uni is so strict to the software stack too. They are teaching Programing stack of Only Microsoft code.
ASP.NET and C#
Obviously it's latest versions and all, but still, why not teach the students latest modern technologies if available?

[23-Mar-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
What if the students want to learn other language than C#?

[23-Mar-19 01:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Anyway, at least they teach latest version

[23-Mar-19 01:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but still what they teach is an already made project explaining go here, go there, and you end up here.
The student absolutely lost thinking what the hell he/she learnt

[23-Mar-19 01:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅

[23-Mar-19 01:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The student is instead learning from Udemy.com

[23-Mar-19 01:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
😄

[23-Mar-19 01:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
why not at the first place Just learn from Udemy!

[23-Mar-19 01:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Because M$ft is all they know
I took a course from one of the largest online unis, had a site issue and the answer was "Well it works fine with Internet Explorer, use that"

[23-Mar-19 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
IE 🤦

[23-Mar-19 01:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
__Nothing__ "works fine with Internet Explorer" 🤦🏽

[23-Mar-19 01:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Our local "trade school"/2-year college spends 5% of their revenue annually on M$ft licensing 🤷🏽

[23-Mar-19 01:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know a thing about C#, or I could help the student a bit there

[23-Mar-19 01:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
she's totally lost there 😄

[23-Mar-19 01:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was too lazy to learn much C#

[23-Mar-19 01:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I learned all these languages on my graduation. Forgot them all, since I did not practice.

[23-Mar-19 01:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
C, C++, Java, VB, VB.NET, C#, APS.NET

[23-Mar-19 01:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't remember any of them today.

[23-Mar-19 01:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I remember the fundamental rules, that helped me with the coding what I did so far with other languages I coded in.

[23-Mar-19 01:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
saw your comment on VB, I would have also preferred to use VB over VB.NET and C# mate

[23-Mar-19 01:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
VB was far easier than other desktop application coding

[23-Mar-19 01:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's amazing at how fast you lose it, I spent a loooooooong time writing VB and now I open studio and am like "OK, dafuq do I do now?"

[23-Mar-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I would have also preferred to use VB over VB.NET`
I tend to not make the distinction in general conversations, but I migrated to .NET quickly and never looked back

I'm learning C again when I get chance at the end of my day.
Even if I know the concept I still watch the video or read the chapter, because I know I'll get something out of it which I either have forgotton or I didn't knew it earlier.
