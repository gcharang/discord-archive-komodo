As soon as he's comfortable and gets excited talking about the project, others do too.

[29-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
There were a few moments in the crypto rich interview that the energy was reallly good.

[29-Nov-18 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I want someone to hit fishy with challenging questions and ones that get him excited`
for that, I'm not sure... most that I've seen do interviews don't really know enough to know what *to* ask (if that makes any sense)

[29-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504

`Crypto Rich did well, I'd just like to see more.`
Yeah he actually did much better than I was expecting and I think that was in large part due to the fact that he was *actually* interested in learning about PIRATE

[29-Nov-18 07:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yes 100% he is really into the project.

[29-Nov-18 07:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe THAT is the avenue to work with. 
Introduce the project to some influencers
Tell them that if they are EXCITED about the project, that a video interview or live can be set up. 
Vet them to make sure they are indeed excited,  prioritize the ones that are.

[29-Nov-18 07:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504

since we were still only doing trades OTC at the time, I think we missed a good chunk of that audience (especially now that all markets are depressed)

Hey guys what other Projects do you Guys follow/like outside of the komodo Ecosystem ?

such things exist? 😮

jokes aside, it's hard enough just trying to follow all of the things __inside__ the Komodo Ecosystem

following shit is more than a full-time job
