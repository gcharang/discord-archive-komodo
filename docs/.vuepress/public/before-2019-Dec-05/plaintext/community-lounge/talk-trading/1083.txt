Choose two or three use cases that are not too complex and describe how KMD facilitates business. Avoid the buzz words if possible and I would also avoid “free”.  It’s confusing. “Free internet” sounds like some shit Bernie would try to promise instead of whatever KMD means by free.

I’m not sure what would be the best descriptor for Komodo,  but I think we should tap into the counter movement in crypto ( show as a strength not bowing down to arbitrary government laws and fear mongering ) .

Btc will soon require MTL for LN nodes,   Cryptos requiring KYC/AML for wallets let alone exchange.   At that point ,  what is any difference to fiat?

[18-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Markus#5464
I have a few real life friends who invest into crypto and they all share same thing about Komodo, they never see anyone talking about it

[18-Aug-19 04:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That can be boiled down to three reasons:  1) We aren’t getting out there enough in person 2)  Not paying influencers to shill on our behalf.  3).  Komodo is real competition that renders 90+% of cryptocurrencies redundant or obsolete and why would people share the thing that will destroy them.

I watched a crypto analyst youtuber recently who mentioned that he can see that interest in crypto overall in decreassing he was checking fiat flowing into crypto, google word searches and so on and all of that basically been decreassing

[18-Aug-19 04:30 PM] Markus#5464
he was also pretty upset over how Tether is playing around with the market, something like 75% of all volume is by Tether

[18-Aug-19 04:31 PM] Markus#5464
usd was only 8%

@polycryptoblog Altho i feel like KMD team is holding on to information sometimes way too long without revealing anything about any upcoming new things like partnerships. And  i have heard that reason being cause the team want organic growth not hype based. But i think it would not only bring hype but also liquidity to the market

[18-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Markus#5464
Binance 15 btc 24h volume, its pretty dry 😢

[18-Aug-19 04:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Best not to count chicks before they have hatched especially with the issues we have had in the past,  k64 and monaize .   We also do not work the CEX like other coins do,  though I think a 3rd party Komodo based business should take up that role ,  but marketmaking is dangerous territory ,  should probably work as a pressure raiser rather than  for feigned liquidity

[18-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Markus#5464
I think future of KMD is quite unclear, there is so much talk about what is needed for it to succeed, that other businesses gonna market kmd tech and what not. But will it rly be like that?

[18-Aug-19 04:48 PM] Markus#5464
I read about RFox quite sometime ago, i have not rly heard anything about it since the IEO

[18-Aug-19 04:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They have launched zaddex with 0CU ,  I know that he is in China currently working on something .  Haven’t followed it to closely.    Tech needs to get to production before it gets marketed by proxy

I have sold all of my coins for $38K, a loss $242K. I have paid dearly for my stupidity.

I do hope that everyone who is still waiting for a miracle is rewarded in the end. My prayers to you all.

who said it was 280k of his own money

[18-Aug-19 06:13 PM] Markus#5464
maybe he had 10k and made it into 280k

[18-Aug-19 06:13 PM] richardt#2807

That's the problem of crypto isnt it, everyone wants to hold it, not spend it

[19-Aug-19 03:04 AM] PTYX#6840
A new wave of payment apps and financial services is being built on stable currencies and around Bitcoin. Those will likely see more mainstream use since altcoins are mostly speculative.

[19-Aug-19 03:06 AM] PTYX#6840
The stable currencies that are available do reduce the cost of transactions and provide frictionless payments but they still need to be optimized to reduce transaction fees further.

@Rongarvin99 @KomodoPlatform For any coin/project to use nSPV, it would have to be built on $KMD platform and dPOW /notarized which cost about 300 -500 kmd a year. So 100 projects wanting to utilize nSPV would equal about 30000 -50000 kmd demand annually.

[19-Aug-19 07:16 AM] Mark81#4505
Well if those projects would purchase kmd and pay it with APR they would need to buy 6000 to 10000kmd for that range.

if btc hold 10k as new support then its a rounded bottom which may signal the start of the normal multi year bull market

[19-Aug-19 11:56 AM] nocturnal#2177
