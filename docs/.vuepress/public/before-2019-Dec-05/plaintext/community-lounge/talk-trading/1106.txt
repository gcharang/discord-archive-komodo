& to be clear we obviously intend to keep our promises made in our NN campaign

[03-Sep-19 02:01 AM] VoskCoin#1869
im not upset, just setting the record straight lol

[03-Sep-19 02:01 AM] VoskCoin#1869
& its just a few days 😄

[03-Sep-19 02:02 AM] VoskCoin#1869
thats a great suggestion, definitely plan to have some of the team members / NN operators on this/next year

@Ramirez I have vouch from OURC and Zexo Komodo ecosystem coin otc trade escrows 😃

[03-Sep-19 02:13 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If you’re legit and send first, can do in small batches as you wish

[03-Sep-19 02:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I’ll take as many Komodo as you have

[03-Sep-19 02:14 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I know it’s most likely a scam 😂 but if you’re happy to follow my terms, I’m more than happy to take every single one of them off your hands

[03-Sep-19 02:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Who can say no to cheap Komodo :2561_feelsevilman:

[03-Sep-19 02:31 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
are you selling 700k kmd? @Ramirez

[03-Sep-19 02:41 AM] allbits#5898
@Ramirez this is exactly what Atomicdex is for

[03-Sep-19 03:06 AM] allbits#5898
Yes anyone can install Atomicdex-API

You mean anyone, as in... anyone can cook? (But really shouldn’t) 😛 or is it fairly straight forward?

[03-Sep-19 07:34 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
370 k on half marketprice lmao

[03-Sep-19 07:34 AM] PTYX#6840
It's straight forward for an app developer

@VoskCoin 5k views from 90k subs is low that is why i assumed some of the subs are bought. Are you saying subs cant be bought slowly?  In any case i @ you previously when i discussed the exact same thing and got no response so did not think it would make much of a difference.

So when can the community expect a video out of you? When you applied in S2 you got a video then nothing when you did not get in. Now you got in and with the rebrand and other "events" we have not seen a peep out of you. You say you hate people using revshare but you have been elected due to your social media reach yet we have not seen any of that in action.

@Ramirez is a scammer, using a fake jl777c escrow to scam BTC out of people @Crabby Paddy @Gordon Komodo

soon 5.8k will it hold?

[03-Sep-19 08:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
1k will hold 😛

[03-Sep-19 08:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Market dumping 75k is normal at these prices

[03-Sep-19 08:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone is doing it for a reason

[03-Sep-19 08:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Same as the 750k dumps

[03-Sep-19 08:43 AM] Markus#5464
Quite sceptical about alts recovering

[03-Sep-19 08:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Not alts in general

[03-Sep-19 08:44 AM] Markus#5464
but i will hold and we will see, either it goes to shit or it doesnt :troll_lol:

[03-Sep-19 08:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is where real utility should be the driver in price

[03-Sep-19 08:44 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Riding this train to 0 if need be 🙂

At this point im in same boat, i traded kmd well until recently there seem to be no bottom in sight

[03-Sep-19 08:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well i have be hodling since 75k 😛

[03-Sep-19 08:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ummm yeah

[03-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Markus#5464
my avg is around 11k i believe

[03-Sep-19 08:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
My average is not 75k thankfully

[03-Sep-19 08:46 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But yeah i would expect a turn around in good alts

[03-Sep-19 08:46 AM] Markus#5464
I hope so 😅

[03-Sep-19 08:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
KMD being one of them once we fix the liquidity issue

[03-Sep-19 08:48 AM] Markus#5464
Are u able to make ur own modules to ur chain or are u limited to antara modules?

[03-Sep-19 08:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you can make your own modules, you would be better off just coding it from scratch

[03-Sep-19 08:49 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[03-Sep-19 08:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
It is not really hard

[03-Sep-19 08:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think there would be much in terms of revenue from that

[03-Sep-19 08:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But as a ecosystem onboarding project, that will add value

[03-Sep-19 08:50 AM] Markus#5464
I wonder if kmd will add centralized module options so that eventually companies in need of centralised options can use that

[03-Sep-19 08:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
To get people talking and excited, the market maker and people using the DEX for trades will be the best way of doing that

[03-Sep-19 08:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
They will just need to run all their nodes

[03-Sep-19 08:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There is no issues with that

[03-Sep-19 08:51 AM] Markus#5464
Thinking something like instead of dpow they might want to protect their own chain with checkpoints or something similar

[03-Sep-19 08:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yeah they can do stuff like only specific pub keys can mine etc

[03-Sep-19 08:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But all these things will just need to be added in

[03-Sep-19 08:52 AM] Markus#5464
Hm okay

[03-Sep-19 08:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Or you can premine 100% then have POS protecting the network

[03-Sep-19 08:52 AM] Markus#5464
Ye true

[03-Sep-19 08:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But that would not be something that will bring a lot of utility

[03-Sep-19 08:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The focus should be on the DEX, that is where the need is most needed and will be the main driver for user adoption

[03-Sep-19 08:53 AM] Markus#5464
Well yea it can get huge if done in perfect way

[03-Sep-19 08:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
😛 lets try or die like all the other alts lol

[03-Sep-19 08:54 AM] Markus#5464
maybe DEX will start next alt season

[03-Sep-19 08:54 AM] Markus#5464
👌

[03-Sep-19 08:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No but once it solves the DEX liquidity problem, people will have more choice, do they pay slightly higher prices for privacy or lower and they will need to provide a blood sample

[03-Sep-19 08:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Right now there is no choice

[03-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Markus#5464
Well to me even trading any pair u wish is a huge thing

[03-Sep-19 08:55 AM] Markus#5464
if i wanna trade kmd for doge i can

[03-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Markus#5464
on CEX u cant

[03-Sep-19 08:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Remember the goal is to bring the liquidity of  all the exchanges into the DEX creating the worlds largest orderbook

[03-Sep-19 08:56 AM] Markus#5464
Indeed

[03-Sep-19 08:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Think bitstamp/binance/coinbase/kraken all in 1 orderbook

[03-Sep-19 08:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So not just match a CEX but we surpass it with the deepest orderbooks

[03-Sep-19 08:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Dont forget the liquidity multiplier, have 1 BTC, have a buy on 100 pairs no problem

[03-Sep-19 08:57 AM] Markus#5464
yes its cool never seen before

[03-Sep-19 09:18 AM] willofleo#7505
"But that would not be something that will bring a lot of utility

" @hyperDEX  I agree with this also

[03-Sep-19 09:24 AM] willofleo#7505
if it goes well it will only be a scalability issue

[03-Sep-19 09:25 AM] willofleo#7505
not sure antatra will bring in the numbers maybe talent but dex will bring in the hoard

[03-Sep-19 09:25 AM] Flint#6435
competitors are not asleep! Binance also works on atomic swaps and dex. they will have no problems with liquidity and we return to the question of the usefulness of the Komodo token! Why should someone use a chest of drawers where instead of it, for example, bitcoin can be used in sidechains such as lightning

[03-Sep-19 09:28 AM] Acura#2748
Where can i read about this that binance is working on Atomicswaps for there Dex @Flint

[03-Sep-19 09:30 AM] willofleo#7505
but binance will require kyc regardless

[03-Sep-19 09:30 AM] Flint#6435
Of course, investors and maximalists would like their own Komodo token to grow in price, but the Komodo platform and the like can use Bitcoin as an operational token - not now - so in the future when they will solve bandwidth problems! and creating your own token is for the most part a desire to raise funds precisely in your own project and in the pockets of early investors! for all the genius of the platform, it is worth noting that the need for its own token is not needed for most projects!

[03-Sep-19 09:32 AM] Acura#2748
Actually binance Dex is tokenbased / middlemen etc

[03-Sep-19 09:33 AM] Flint#6435
@Acura  all that is possible in principle is feasible! atomic swap technology is available not only to the Komodo developer guru - if the technology is really so cool then don’t doubt that the most profitable exchange is working on it - and as for the release, it will be postponed until better times when the market comes to its senses to make more money! do not forget that this is the same market as everyone else with the same principles, albeit a little with its own characteristics!

[03-Sep-19 09:37 AM] Acura#2748
Time will tell

[03-Sep-19 09:38 AM] Flint#6435
Binance has so much money that it is possible to hire any available developer to solve certain problems! and good developer work costs a lot of money! ask yourself who in the competition to finance their own project surpasses the finance or KMD? only genius jl777 saves the situation, but if the whole project rests on one person, then this is not entirely good

[03-Sep-19 09:41 AM] willofleo#7505
maybe binanace will buy up DEX , or devs giving them an offer they cant refuse when they see what mm2 dex is capable of  when fully launched , if they dont finish their own dex first, most likly when they see mm2 dex doing large volume they might do such , as it much efficient

[03-Sep-19 09:43 AM] Flint#6435
the strength of the binance lies in its ability to finance the most complex development tasks that cannot be solved with the bare enthusiasm and altruism of home developers! the personal time of many of them amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars and a decentralized model of financial management cannot compete in speed and efficiency with a centralized model of binance! we need liquidity! you need REAL use of the Komodo token in addition to white paper and fantastic fantasies of the future - this is a very competitive environment where your open source tomorrow will copy a stronger and financially powerful competitor and overshadow you - this is the cornerstone of open source

[03-Sep-19 09:47 AM] jorian#4555
the weakness of binance is that it is binance. a centralized company focussed on trading only

you are in some case congruent but I think you over estimate economical power

[03-Sep-19 09:49 AM] jorian#4555
> use Bitcoin as an operational token
not sure if you mean this, but even when (if ever) they solve bandwidth problems, it can never be an operational token. and bandwidth is only 1 of the many problems Bitcoin has

[03-Sep-19 09:50 AM] Acura#2748
If I can say so, Binance would never relinquish control of its own Dex - they will always somehow install a middleman just to comply with the rules.

[03-Sep-19 09:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Whether what you say will be true or not, I think we can all agree that amongst projects, komodo is leading the way technologically and they are constantly releasing new things without worrying about overspending, marketing and all that bs. If Komodo doesn’t succeed, I don’t think any of the current shitcoins will either 😬

[03-Sep-19 09:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I got my bet on Komodo :labs:

[03-Sep-19 10:00 AM] phideas#8309
Regulatory pressure is increasing. Komodo is maybe the most immune tech available.

[03-Sep-19 10:00 AM] Flint#6435
its not necessary to use the Bitcoin token itself directly! you can use its derivatives built on a particular platform and supported by stablecoins and you get, for example (BTCkmd) a token with the characteristics of a chest of drawers and with liquidity and relative stability of bitcoin itself! fintech as it is! so why do you need your own token with such liquidity and unreliability? do you understand that institutional investors will not come to invest in komodo for many years? They are just looking at Bitcoin - the ICO hype has passed - the bubble has burst - komodo can recover, but hardly in the near future! everything starts to revolve around bitcoin itself! and without institutional, this game is like a casino! weak hands can drop us the price three times more if panic starts although this is panic now

[03-Sep-19 10:02 AM] Flint#6435
@phideas  and why is this immunity stronger than the rest? Where is the objective indicator of excellence that can be measured statistically and mathematically? something other than developer activity?
