@FishyGuts so that would mean any kmd asset is easy to get t on cb now?

[09-Feb-19 08:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
"easy" if you got the money. They want around 3BTC to list a new coin

[09-Feb-19 09:03 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
when binance increased the withdrawal fee to 0.002? 😒

[09-Feb-19 09:32 AM] hastrup#8742
@dukeleto I did not mean "easy" as in 3 btc that is expensive and however paid for it is a Saint!! I mean there is little to no work for cb to list another komodo asset. And then like dp one could get a bundle deal.

The CB listing fee also includes wallet maintenance and updates going forward, iirc, which can be a good amount of work.

i see why ppl accuse coinbene for fake volume

[09-Feb-19 04:29 PM] Markus#5464
checking kmd atm and no trades being done, order book doesnt move at all and theres big gaps and it keep adding market trades without order book even moving at all

[09-Feb-19 04:34 PM] richardt#2807
@Markus Yeah I also noticed a lot of wash trading on there.  Quite disappointing.

what happened to all the volume? 145 BTC on binance yesterday . today 38 BTC hmm.....?

[10-Feb-19 08:46 AM] Likewise#6767
on most if not all exchanges volume is heavily manipulated, just shows us there is as good as no interest

[10-Feb-19 08:50 AM] Likewise#6767
probably all in house trading to keep prices from crashing to zero 😉

[10-Feb-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
0.5% per day of marketcap seems to be what KMD averages.

[10-Feb-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
with "normal" cryptos trading 10% to 100% of their marketcap per day, 0.5% seems very low but maybe the 10% to 100% per day is crazy high?

if we could compare crypto trades volume daily vs total cap of those - how it is in context of stock exchange shares volume daily compared to total evaluation of a company?

[10-Feb-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
dramatically higher

[10-Feb-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont think any major stock is trading 5% of its marketcap per day

[10-Feb-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
considering some marketcaps are a trillion dollars...

[10-Feb-19 03:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imo trading 100% of market cap a day says a lot about the manipulation of a given coin

[10-Feb-19 03:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It only means that most volume is just wash trading.

[10-Feb-19 03:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
For a community that talks so much about holding, trading 100% of marketcap in a day,  says a different story

[10-Feb-19 04:14 PM] richardt#2807
Anybody know what's the deal with coinbene?  It's stating 153 BTC, 24 hour volume.  But looking at the market trades, like 99% of it are wash trades...

[10-Feb-19 04:18 PM] richardt#2807
I guess good news is CMC hasn't included Coinbene volume for KMD, so probably most of the volume seen on CMC now are real trades

[10-Feb-19 04:21 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
from a recent research Coinbene has 99% fake volume

maybe this explains why KMD volume is so "low", we only were on exchanges with real volumes.

0.5% to 1% per day of marketcap trading doesnt seem to be so low in real world terms, ie. $5 billion per day of a trillion dollar marketcap stock

[10-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Lanii#8302
Even compared to many shitcoins on Binance, kmd is almost always low on volume.

[10-Feb-19 04:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

No reason to force trades just to raise volume

[10-Feb-19 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
why not? people are complaining there is lack of volume. if everybody traded like monkeys and to each other, there would be a lot more volumes and make the people complaining happier. isnt their happiness important to you?

You can pretend like it doesn't matter but its sad when shitcoins move and the coins you have that have great FA don't move because lack of volume

You can dump BTC like the shitcoin it is and move out of 2009

Consensus stopped being a thing the second that consensus stopped mattering to the BTC community and the economics of Coinbase were allowed to dictate what is/isn't BTC

[10-Feb-19 05:28 PM] Lanii#8302
Yes perhaps it doesn't have the best tech now but that doesn't rly matter. Btc is what it is because of its history and not random new shitcoins on mass print

[10-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Lanii#8302
Anyway, since you don't agree with this

[10-Feb-19 05:29 PM] Lanii#8302
