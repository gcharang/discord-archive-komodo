Well fiat wise, about x5

[25-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or x10, I don’t even remember

[25-Apr-19 12:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
🤷‍♂️

[25-Apr-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you haven't made positive gains on KMD at any time in the last 2 years, then your margins are too close or your vision is, I don't know which

[25-Apr-19 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and I say that with it being 1/2 the price I 1st bought in at 🤷🏽

[25-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

there is no point to go anywhere. even if you go for a change, you will find things are missing in other places which you can find here

What is the progress on bitmex CC?

[25-Apr-19 12:16 PM] klein#5233
HODL for the longest time

[25-Apr-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_holds just enough outside of this ecosystem to perpetuate what he does inside it and a tiny BTC "nest egg"_

[25-Apr-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
@Markus it even has a gui, check out #cc-prices

[25-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Markus#5464
@jl777c  nice will check it out

[25-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Tezos is performing very well for me

[25-Apr-19 12:18 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Everything else outside of KMD ecosystem/Tezos is a fetid corpse on my blockfolio

the hodlgame is strong in VOTE2019

[25-Apr-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I figure more votes will be cast on the final day than any other

[25-Apr-19 12:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
I agree and some will be wasted because they are late by a few minutes

[25-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what is the vote snapshot time/blockheight?

[25-Apr-19 12:59 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many coins are sitting on exchanges?

[25-Apr-19 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Last year about 40% voted, in theory more should vote this year?

[25-Apr-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i would think less due to bear market exhaustion

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
How many “expired” utxo’s are there for interest?

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Probably give a good indication of participation

[25-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Show how many checked out during bear

[25-Apr-19 01:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
>>what is the vote snapshot time/blockheight?
It's either one block before ON or after 14 May 00.00 UTC but afaik this has not been communicated yet.
The snapshot for the airdrop was the one closest to 00.00 UTC ( which was before 00:00) maybe it's the same logic for the cut of point... kolo is the election master

[25-Apr-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
change in coinsupply indicates only half are diligently collecting their rewards by being active users

if you can time it exactly, you can make a bit of incremental returns by selling at 20k, buyback at 19k

[25-Apr-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you miss the turn and get stuck on sidelines

[25-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Markus#5464

A couple of those turns looked really deceptive.  That one with the gravel on the left tricked a lot of drivers.
