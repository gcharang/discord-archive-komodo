Why would one still mine with gfx cards?

`Why would one still mine with gfx cards?`
Because we still like profits?

Hey all, if anyone wants to offload some KMD I'm connected to a fund looking to buy in >$150k blocks. DM if interested!

you can buy them on binance/bittrex

[11-Dec-18 07:19 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Not without significant slippage...

[11-Dec-18 07:22 AM] OsTa#2589
just put a buy order, you will see it will be filled 😉

[11-Dec-18 07:23 AM] OsTa#2589
big order don't stay a lot of time

lot of people will sell their KMD (because it was blocked since 15nov)

[11-Dec-18 07:24 AM] OsTa#2589
so good time to buy at cheaper price

[11-Dec-18 07:24 AM] OsTa#2589

be careful about OTC trade @yousurnayme  😉

[11-Dec-18 07:30 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Daily trading volumes on even the bigger exchanges are well under $150k, so you can be sure that a big purchase will have a big effect on prices

[11-Dec-18 07:31 AM] yousurnayme#1631
Appreciate you looking out, you're right that OTC can be a little hairy sometimes

[11-Dec-18 07:52 AM] OsTa#2589
you can invest weeks per weeks if you don't want to affect the market price. And it will allow you to spread your investment (don't buy everything at same price)

[11-Dec-18 09:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
A month ago the price was twice what it is now. Guess that goes without saying. But the push up in price may help your investment in the long run @yousurnayme

I’m trying to buy a coin and they keep bidding over me

[11-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Is there an easy way to combat this? Say buy price is 100 sell is 300

[11-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I’m putting decent range 150 160 170 and they outbid me 1

[11-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Does selling into bot work? Or they have more funds tucked away

[11-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or is there a point where they won’t go further and they sell to you?

[11-Dec-18 10:33 AM] actionslacks#4072
Patience, or buy a bot and get your api keys from the exchange

[11-Dec-18 10:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
Be prepared to lose some coin while learning though.

[11-Dec-18 10:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
I guess now that crypto is cheap it may be a good time. I’ve been down the rabbit hole and back. Arbitrage was the closest I got to a sure thing. But that was a couple years ago.

[11-Dec-18 10:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
You can also lose your mind trying to figure out how bots will react. Just look for patterns.

more sellers than buyers

[11-Dec-18 11:37 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or the sellers want to buy in bulk and not bump the price up until they've bought :P

"A monthly closing below 2950 will confirm the long-term trend is turning down. A year-end closing below 4150 will point to a drop back to 775 area"

I don't know but I think btc price must be kept above a certain level, otherwise it would be vulnerable to 51% due to miners leaving

all this price speculation talk is pointless. people serious about tech are not in here for quick buck. in the long term it will work out very nicely anyways, so why sweat.
time spent on looking at prices could be spent more productively, like actually coding something or educating people about the core benefits that all this tech brings

[11-Dec-18 05:26 PM] PHBA2061#2530
*time spent on looking at prices could be spent more productively, like actually coding something or educating people about the core benefits that all this tech brings*  => well said 👍

[12-Dec-18 12:23 AM] bishop#9773
I thought you were going to script sends to occur on release?

[12-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Didn’t say I wasn’t

[12-Dec-18 12:46 AM] bishop#9773
sure but I would have figured an automatic script would have beat him moving unless he did something similar

[12-Dec-18 12:47 AM] bishop#9773
loop through sendtoaddress commands for each address by doing a check against >= current blockheight with the unlocked blockheight.
