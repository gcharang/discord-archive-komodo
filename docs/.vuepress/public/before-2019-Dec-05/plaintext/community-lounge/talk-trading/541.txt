also, managing notary node is really replacing your day job with notary node manager kinda level job

[13-Apr-19 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no matter how much you automate your stuff to whatever level possible, you always has to be present to fix the issue you have on your node

Curious to hear new applicants views on this.

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
else your node will fell behind in notarization ranks

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you have to accept that you just have to be present to fix your notary node

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ALL THE TIME!

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ANYTIME!

Administering a NN is much more work than i thought when i started

[13-Apr-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is why world around team is best

every minute that your NN is down is revenue lost, fact

I have seen myself looking for internet desperately in Cuba while i was in vacations to do some update or make sure all is well

[13-Apr-19 12:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I had to stop at mid highway to connect to nodes to be make some update or restart iguana or some daemon

[13-Apr-19 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought having a top notch AWS node will be good to have with automation, which @ns408 did a lot on our meshbits nodes.
All such automation didn't do much, neither the top notch AWS servers

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is those who have been persistantly available to their nodes ALL the time takes the lead

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
not the automation, it does some good, but too much

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I have had to carry my laptop literally everywhere this year just to be sure i am safe to make any fix

[13-Apr-19 12:12 PM] CrisF#3405
```I’d say most devs could but not a lot would.```
This expresses my thoughts very well.
With time and effort, I think  many could run a node and even become good at it.
I wonder how many would put that in over the longer term...
@FishyGuts  new applicant here :abusedsmily:

I have had to deal with mad wife, daughters, family and coworkers because ive had to cut family days to go fix something on the node.

😂 

[13-Apr-19 12:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its actually much more work intense than many other crypto jobs

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why dedicated community members make the best candidates, especially those that have been #kmdlabs  notaries

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And to be frank, at the prices that kmd had last year, the nodes were not paying enough for the amount of work being done

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd very highly recommend the new notary node operators to be Totally commit yourself to Notary Nodes.
Else DO NOT RUN in the elections.

[13-Apr-19 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
You will waste your time and money

[13-Apr-19 12:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Two very true statements.

[13-Apr-19 12:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Imagine being paid $1,000 usd a month for a full time dev job and having to pay your own sub fees.   I’d capitulate 😜

[13-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
wondering if running nn will ever be made easier in the future?

[13-Apr-19 12:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And yes Grewal, it’s why I think MrLynch quit is job.   It’s a full time gig.

[13-Apr-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
At one point it was less than $1k a month

[13-Apr-19 12:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Taking into account some admins pay almost $500 a month for servers

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Gordon Komodo the setup and maintenance seems to be able to be automated to a degree but no AI exists to spot and fix the problems that these capable people can.

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
not for many years, it is already much easier than before, but i dont expect it will become like point and click. the point for NN is for it to require technical expertise

{Reactions}
👌 

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
having 64 technically capable people added to the community

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
16 to 64 😜

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
this is much better for ecosystem than if it was so easy to do that anybody could

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] CrisF#3405
And people with a stake in Komodo ☝

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Or... 21-64? 🤷‍♂️

[13-Apr-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we are already at close to 50 operators last year

[13-Apr-19 12:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The 1st year I did some dedication managing my 2 notary nodes. Did fine, not too much, go auto-reelected and elected somehow.
2nd year I did not manage my nodes myself entirely and left it to @ns408 and the automation.
focused on other programming stuff and learning, with as much less responsibilities I can have over my head.
did poor, I'm out of notary nodes, and don't wish to be a notary node now.
Being a Notary Node operator is a constant pressure to manage it. It is really like a 24/7 job.
much much much dedicated job than your normal 8-5 job.

[13-Apr-19 12:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
True.  I just want to make sure the FUD doesn’t start 😂

KMD is centralized.  It’s 52 NN ops not 64!!!   SCAM!!

[13-Apr-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
show me any other coin where 75% of mined blocks are evenly distributed to 52 different

[13-Apr-19 12:19 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Oh, and that is without mentioning the mid night wake up alarms because of some issue or emergency update that needed to be done at 2 or 3am your timezone

[13-Apr-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
most coins, even BTC, have majority of hashrate in the hands of 6 pool operators

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Family costs are intangible to all buy the NN, yet they are probably huge.

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu - Chainmakers not sure if ppl will belive me, I paid 2200+ NZD per month for my both notary nodes all together.

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
and dont tell me that thousands of miners are contributing the hashrate, the reality is that the pool operator controls what is mined

[13-Apr-19 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this whole season

just because I was trying to keep things on AWS and changing an IP is a mess once it's used from beginning.

[13-Apr-19 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the most best option is having a Co-location server. Your very own!

[13-Apr-19 12:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was best experience in my 1st year having a colocation own server

[13-Apr-19 12:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
AWS is not good in my opinion for Notary Nodes

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Speaking of nodes, does running Komodo in native mode and leaving it on all day help at all?

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hardware is very very important. Dont think that being cheap will help in anyway

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, running a full node helps network connectivity

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Kitchen Table being a client node of any blockchain daemon with full node helps the network

[13-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
especially if you have very good bandwidth

[13-Apr-19 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I started with a cheaper server and it basically cost me the auto-reelection.

[13-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Well that's good to know. I've been having mine running non stop for years. Just making sure.

agree @siu - Chainmakers

[13-Apr-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And its not just knowjng to build daemons and set them up. It A LOT of deep linux sysadmin knowledge too

[13-Apr-19 12:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll think about standing in election in coming years, may be, but not until I sort myself with my programming skills that I have picked up on

[13-Apr-19 12:27 PM] CrisF#3405
What kind of things, @siu - Chainmakers ?

[13-Apr-19 12:28 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

Every new coin has their own dependencies and version of those dependencies that you need to set to work with specific daemons and not with others

@jl777c when our notary nodes and dPoW system started, I expressed NEM's masternode kinda setup, which was automated.
that is different, and after this much of time and experience, I think our elections and notary nodes management is one unique system that I think nobody is doing.

[13-Apr-19 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
because our solution secures Other Blockchains

[13-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
If you asked other projects about their voting, if they even have it, you'll receive an answer about being more hardcore and you should buy the coin.

all I know is that anyone that thinks being a NN is an "easy way to get rich" is either delusion, misinformed, so poor that they don't understand what "rich" is, or a combination of those

[13-Apr-19 12:36 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Imagine having a full linux admin job that pays around $150k a year anywhere but doing it during a bear market that pays a fraction of that.

[13-Apr-19 12:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Kitchen Table as to running a node, I am literally writing a guide right now on how to set one up on the www.nodl.it - I have been running KMD and ARRR full nodes for over a week.  It will be out in a few days.   Special thanks to @radix42 for getting the previous port back up and running.
