Anyone else about to fill bags? What price are you looking at? I'm ready to go just my bags.

waiting for btc to take a shit

[04-Apr-19 01:16 PM] Markus#5464
then hopefully alts some good once will drop aswell so that we then can get a quick discount 😁

I don’t play those games anymore

[04-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Markus am counting on it

[04-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
now a nice drop with lots of blood would be good for final capitulation

vbk shows there are still too many dumb cunts in this crypto space

[04-Apr-19 01:51 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
There will always be dumb cunts in this space

Shut up @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 I don’t wanna hear it

[04-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[04-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
You always suspect something like that in the back of your mind but to actually see it was hilarious

Sweep the Low (@ibuycheapcoins)

@SmartContracter My concern is the 50 week moving average. It has been major resistance the whole bear market and one last rejection led to the spring from the last bear market. It would take us to range lows.

VBK is going to shit blood

[04-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
its funny how so many ppl rly think this is a start of a bullrun

[04-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
it was manipulated

[04-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Markus#5464
it was going to get rejected by 4.2k resistance but 100 mil order pumped it

[04-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
volume was getting lower and lower

[04-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Markus#5464
probably the guy who bought btc for 100 mil also did a 100x long on bitmex with a big stack

[04-Apr-19 02:19 PM] Markus#5464
so everyones losses went to him 😄

[04-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

There won’t be a cryptotwitter after this

[04-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah short squeeze for real... 500mil in liquidations...

[04-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Dont think we will go sub 1k, but retest of 3.3 seems plausible

[04-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Markus#5464
if he did 100x he did 20000% only from 20% increasse

[04-Apr-19 02:24 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

Man, I love these people 😎

[04-Apr-19 02:50 PM] Markus#5464
does that affect kmd's dpow if notarizations dont get confirmed in time?

[04-Apr-19 02:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only on the secondary level, on the main level NNs still produce the equivalent of live checkpoints on the KMD chain itself

[04-Apr-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it is designed to handle this

[04-Apr-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
of course it is better if it was confirmed but tx in mempool is still findable by bitcoind

[04-Apr-19 02:55 PM] Markus#5464

When someone posts that $KMD is a centralized shitcoin but ignores the fact that anyone can launch any chain under KMD with no authorization or payment to KMD needed, electoral processes, community dev growth and more, there are two ingredients needed for this IMO, apathy ...

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
lol the guys in the chat are wondering why bittrex doesnt pump the price like binance does

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and 'bittrex doesnt have marketmakers'

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm not really sure how they think an exchange works... I think 3rd party people normally should be marketmakers, not the exchanges...

[05-Apr-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As that is how you get fake volume etc etc

[05-Apr-19 08:08 AM] Keppie#5156
honestly would not be suprised if binance paid whales at one point to create fake volume tho

[05-Apr-19 08:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or that the project itself did so

[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I mean they raised a shitload of btc

[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Should have used portion of it to pump their own coin, get the fomo crowd in and THEN dump the premine on their sorry asses

[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
like a normal scam project would do

[05-Apr-19 08:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The fact that they didnt, might actually be a clue that they arent scamming, just not very smart at launching

What was IEO price for VBK?

[05-Apr-19 08:53 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Nvm, 10 cents

[05-Apr-19 09:21 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I didnt like when trex supported VBK ico so much, felt strange, and from discussion here I see it's most probably a nicely done well paid scam

[05-Apr-19 09:22 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
such things will never be over, only question why trex risk reputation so cheaply

[05-Apr-19 09:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think one of the trex owner / founder is also on the team / advisor of vbk

[05-Apr-19 09:27 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
non tech guys  like founders easy to manipulate 😃

[05-Apr-19 09:27 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
at least they did it on trex international so in US they will not be charged for supporting scam
