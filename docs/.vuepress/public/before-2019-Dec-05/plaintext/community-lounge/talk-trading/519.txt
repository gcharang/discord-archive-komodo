maybe that's the whole problem with ICOs in the 1st place: people buying in for trade value rather than to support funding of valuable projects they believe in

[06-Apr-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
OTC sales were made at well below the IEO price (during the IEO!)

[06-Apr-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
not to mention the 50 million mined during the test period

[06-Apr-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and the daily 500,000 of mining, which will mostly have to be sold to pay for the BTC fees

[06-Apr-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
other than that, and the closed source, confusion about whether it is just attack detection and not prevention

@jl777c what is your thoughts on current market condition when it comes to bitcoin? does it make sense for this pump in price to sustain without correction?

[06-Apr-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
why not? the price was held steady <$4200 for a long time, such non-volatilty is not natural and indicates it is being suppressed or supported. Like back when it was supported at >$6000, then when the support was removed, it plunged and it never corrected back up other than the DCB (dead cat bounce)

[06-Apr-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so why to expect it will pull back now?

[06-Apr-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, it could all go to $1500 tomorrow if some lunatic sells 1 million BTC at market price

[06-Apr-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
trying to predict day to day price... you need to improve your psychic skills

[06-Apr-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
other than obvious acceleration/deceleration soon after trend changes, DCB and its reverse (not sure its name), there are few "sure things"

[06-Apr-19 09:21 AM] Markus#5464
But if we look at weekly stochastic it have been at max for quite some time, question is how long it will be possible to keep it there without resetting it

[06-Apr-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
markets go a lot longer than you believe it can, they do until they dont

[06-Apr-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you can see it change, but until it changes, you cant see it change

[06-Apr-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
better to react to what the market is doing, than try to predict what it will do

[06-Apr-19 09:23 AM] Markus#5464
Ye true

[06-Apr-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the best I got was 85% accuracy on a 2 hours ahead prediction

[06-Apr-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but with all the spreads, commissions and slippage, it is not easy to convert even an 85% accurate up/down predictor into actual profits

[06-Apr-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
sure you can make a lot more money by knowing the exact market top and bottom, but then again if you have such powers, just buy the winning lotto ticket

[06-Apr-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the easy (and boring way) is to wait for market to change polarity and go all in

[06-Apr-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so now we changed from bear to non-bear and the bull is not confirmed yet. Assuming you did the same on the bull peak when it changed from bull to not bull, I think around $10K price, then cost averaged out for an average of $10K (as it bounced about the $10K price for a while), then you now cost average back in around the $5K price. it is "only" a double and taking a few years to achieve, but it removes the chopped off fingers from trying to catch the falling prices

[06-Apr-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
dont bother to try to predict the exact peak. just wait for it to be confirmed and then switch out over some relatively short period of time, like one to two months

[06-Apr-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
since we are in about a 4 year cycle, maybe 4 months is ok time for the transition

[06-Apr-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
if you back test this over the last few cycles, i think it will show a very good performance, though far far from picking the exact top and bottom. Yes, you "sacrifice" the 50% of price movement that 100% accurate psychic powers would have gotten, but unless you have such psychic powers, those were funds you never had anyway.

[06-Apr-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
can you slam dunk a basketball with one hand on a 3 meter high hoop?

[06-Apr-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
does that make you sad?

[06-Apr-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
not being able to do the impossible, there is no shame in this. Accepting a mere doubling of capital every few years... with relatively low risk. The problem is that the tendency is to want to trade more, which will just cost you more in fees and likely you make bad trades anyway. Best to spend the time doing productive things

Out with a lil gain not touching again until dampening happens. Looks like wallets still locked on bittrex

deposits are still not allowed? this price action is just from IEO and OTC (bittrex) participants??

[06-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess whatever insiders were also allowed to sell the 5000 BTC worth

[06-Apr-19 12:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
both deposit & withdrawal are disabled atm

[06-Apr-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
were deposits ever enabled?

[06-Apr-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, this is just insiders (whale OTC buyers) dumping on the retail buyers. Poor miners that were spending 4000 sats/VBK on BTC spam

[06-Apr-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont know if they have hashrate electricity costs in addition to BTC txfee costs, but just the latter would be a pretty hard cost that needs to be recouped

[06-Apr-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
even at 2000 sats in BTC fees per VBK, that is 10BTC per day of permanent sell pressure

[06-Apr-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
which is fine if daily volume is 5000 BTC

[06-Apr-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but when that reduces to 50 BTC/day, it will be 20% sell pressure

[06-Apr-19 12:36 PM] PHBA2061#2530
afaik, deposits were never enabled on bittrex, but there are some other exchanges that offer vbk deposti/withdrawal

[06-Apr-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
at about a 70% inflation rate, and 10%+ BTC cost sell pressure, it would need to triple in marketcap, just to stay the same price

This thing will dump to oblivion when the wallets open up - lots of miners are waiting for it

Yeah testnet miners were already selling 500-1000 sats otc with big profit margins

[06-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They dgaf about the ieo price

[06-Apr-19 02:04 PM] Post#7345
Many people had high hopes for it, even miners, but as bittrex started trading without an announcements, deposits were not open from the start and still aren´t, no transactions were allowed, a LOT of banning on discord and telegram and the feeling that they just dump on investors will make it a bloodbatch probably. At this point, i really believe, they are fearing to open up the wallet

[06-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Post#7345
I will drop everything at market rate and never look back. This coin was one of the most disgusting experiences for me, feeling dirty just by holding it

[06-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201
There are ppl buying OTC at 1500. You can drop everything like right now.

[06-Apr-19 02:12 PM] Cye_BigDaddy#9201

That seems to be a common theme. Come up with some new coin with tech that already existed in Komodo for years. Make it inferior along with a gimmick name and then bash Komodo about copying and lying. Then watch as your said coin tech doesn't work and people lose money.
