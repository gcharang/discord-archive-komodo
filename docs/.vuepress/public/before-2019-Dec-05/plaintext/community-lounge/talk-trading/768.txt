Well, if Facebook coin gives me easier access to buy bitcoin, then I can swap bitcoin for Pirate, works for me.

[15-Jun-19 01:40 PM] tolken#2655
Unless I have to sign up and use facebook, then it’s no deal 😛

[15-Jun-19 01:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
it will no doubt be effective at discovering facebook users' coinbase holdings/activity. I'm sure they'll get all of that on a nice platter.

[15-Jun-19 01:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
people will be encouraged to link paypal, ebay, and coinbase accts to their fb profile. and why wouldnt you have a fb profile? are you some kind of criminal? "You just cashed out $1000 worth of Zucket's, would you like to post it on your timeline and say something about it?"

@DumbestTweetHub @SatoshiLite Thanks you! Oh no I didn’t know about Bitcoin halving too! I thought it was just the light coins! I’m going to sell all my BTC too! What coins doesn’t get cut in half sir? I have all my money in a few, mostly AXE because I like their deo...

@tolken we ll resume operations soon

[15-Jun-19 02:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
soon™

[15-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
you ll be able to trade ARRR with anything listed

[15-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
soon is better than a date ;). If I don t have enough time to end paranoid checks today I ll open back monday

went deep on developping new tools to add more and more services to secure the app

[15-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
even if it is already secure as hell. My problem is that I secure it too much and block myself :troll:

[15-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
as long as we re in BETA, that s my way of doing

[15-Jun-19 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
but we won t remain in beta for long

[15-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
this whole agama story made me consider rewriting my own roadmap on additional tools to get external checks (external being services I need to develop myself for public)

[15-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
dealing with NN subjects slowed me down, bur I assume my NN role prevails as long as the final release is not here

[15-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
but on this stuff I basically have 2 hands and 1 brain. Time management is key. Soon is cool considering that we had a doubt on the validity of funds

[15-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
so I developped solutions to be able to track whatever address the hac...Bountyman would use

[15-Jun-19 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
official statement about validity of coins means that all KMD are legit

[15-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
unfortunately I began developping this and believe it s a damn concurrential advantage

[15-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
1 step after each other.

[15-Jun-19 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
keep it up, you're doing a good job at executing

[15-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
and because I m so deep in this and want to provide solutions even for NN not linked to Barterlly, some parts were also revamped to make NN internally theorically more secure

[15-Jun-19 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll give my tools, people will have the choice

[15-Jun-19 02:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
(do you want to be backed by a genuine NN statusreport to check forks / NH attacks attempts is the real question)

[15-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
automatically, of course

[15-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
transparently, of course

[15-Jun-19 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
never asked for anything on those tools, and reports, cause I just can t. People can trust it or not, facts are that using non vritical and sensitive data to identify in 1 sec a possible hack attempt **network side**

[15-Jun-19 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
totally harmless, and pushing the paranoia to the max I drawed an implementation to get this with unlimitee sources, be it my own NN or anyone else. the more you add sources the more it will be sensitive to network turbulences in case of unexpected network behaviour

[15-Jun-19 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
instaping when based on facts, I detect a network potential issue is something I want

[15-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
and now I have the way of doing it just pushing a few lines of code.

[15-Jun-19 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can now check some stuff in production servers directly drinking my coca-cola, all automated

[15-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
in the meantime my mate handles the GUI and bots and everything else, we never stop and Il never stop working on it. Downtime or not

running this type of app makes us being considered as a platform or exchange. I won t rely on JL as a cashmachine if my tech is flawed. So I can t fail. Period.

[15-Jun-19 03:09 PM] Deleted User#0000

this made me discover very very dangerous stuff and am not talking about Barterlly

[15-Jun-19 03:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don t fear about Barterlly. It won t open back if all my heads checks are not passed, even if it is secure

friends helped me with funding to convert crypto in fiat for operations... using the app rather than dealing directly with me. That s what I want. rely on code, not people

[15-Jun-19 03:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
choosing battlefronts sorting / order is what will make me even more confident about the solution

[15-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will prove and show what I found, someday, when people will be ready to accept it. ATM, they are not, here again, not linked to Barterlly.

[15-Jun-19 03:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
**public** blockchains, means in itself everything is already here, just hidden in the masses of information.

[15-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
And as I'm ashamed to have the app closed, I can't come back without one or 2 surprises, but they are directly linked to... Time for sync 😉

[15-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
we're here for the longrun and will prove it with facts, not tweets, hot air is for others, not me

[15-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I don't even have twitter, nor use it personally btw)

[15-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm just handling a little project after all, so even asking for devs to contact me when I want to list a coin for free is not possible, noone answers, but at least, I tried.

[15-Jun-19 03:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Famous people opening OTC exchanges backed by hundreds of million dollars just show me I'm on the right track, and will open that market to KMD and related coins.

[15-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Forcing any paid service to be sold in KMD/BTC only will also prove I support the ecosystem

[15-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
this is what matters as long as the app is not in final release :

btw I choosed **on purpose** not to run an ICO, and, hell, things would have been so much easier with it, but I don't work like this and never will, prove first, then we can talk is my way of doing

[15-Jun-19 05:37 PM] crumb#2550
hardupdate will be done this weekend afaik. we still have plenty of time. let's get worried when next week comes and nothing has happened 😛

[15-Jun-19 07:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i processed a bunch more refunds. waiting on 133 to send the smartdust from old address to claimed address
133
also, i checked the assetchains and is seems not many have sent the smartdust either. please send the smartdust from the old address to the claimed address. the refunds will be processed the next day

[15-Jun-19 07:49 PM] figgy132#7531
I've sent smartdust from old address to new for assetchain DEX days ago, have the assetchain returns been processed yet? Because DEX hasn't arrived yet.

[15-Jun-19 07:50 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
the next day according to the previous message

[15-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
next week for assetchains

[15-Jun-19 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810

when can we expect dust for VRSC?

[15-Jun-19 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont have automation for that yet. hopefully next week

[15-Jun-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i am prioritizing by economic value swept and only a very small amount of VRSC was

[15-Jun-19 08:02 PM] jl777c#5810
plz understand there are 14 coins involved

[15-Jun-19 08:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
is there a form for "donate mine because it's not enough to mess with"?

[15-Jun-19 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just dont do anything

[15-Jun-19 08:32 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
This implies swept funds become stolen funds after x amount of time

[15-Jun-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it will stay in the sweep address
