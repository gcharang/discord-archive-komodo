[09-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jorian#4555
oh the fakeout. volume is low, no real push up, lack of capitulation

We need to dump below 6

[09-Oct-18 03:26 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Why would a medium term hodler dump then?

[10-Oct-18 07:55 AM] jorian#4555
there is no volume to support it though

[10-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh we’re gonna need some external push to make it go one way or the other

stock market crash ... at least in australia the dollar here has been falling against USD quite badly last few months, just as I expected it too.. .so having all my money in crypto has been a huge win 😄

[10-Oct-18 08:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think we will see BTC as a safehaven, even though its should not be, the hash rate is so high ....

[10-Oct-18 08:09 AM] snowdamn#2414
reports of lowest volumes on Coinbase not good for ETF, but hope they pull off some type of scheme and accept applications anyway, although i would vote against if i were deciding

finally, bitcoin is dead.

[10-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
That grave keeps getting shallower and shallower

[10-Oct-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, such a shock that tx volumes are down 65% when the price is down 65%. wow totally unexpected

[10-Oct-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
definitely imploding

[10-Oct-18 08:54 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
When flipmodoing?

[10-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
well, all the bitcoin miners are spending thousands of dollars mining each new BTC so clearly BTC will be $5 within days

[10-Oct-18 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
all this nonsense about bitcoin not backed by anything, didnt read the satoshi whitepaper. electricity is being spent to make each and every BTC and the cost of it is a lot more than the ink+paper costs of fiat

[10-Oct-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC is basically representing X amount of electricity

[10-Oct-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and while it is not easy to see electricity,  I can assure you that it is very real

[10-Oct-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as society values electricity, BTC will have value

[10-Oct-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess BTC is going to implode since electricity is free for everyone

[10-Oct-18 09:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The transmission of power would have been free, the idea was to use longitudinal waves to transmit power instead of transverse waves.  His radiant energy receiver still doesn't have the storage technology to capitalize on  the leeching of naturally flowing charge. Supercapacitors don't work with it either,  I tried.

If this keeps going, i can see btc core actually go to shit

[10-Oct-18 10:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
How is that the core team leader is actually arguing in favor of credit cards rather than paying directly in btc

[10-Oct-18 10:29 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
All with the excuse that bitpay is a traitor??? WTF is happening to thess guys? Are they toddlers or something?

[10-Oct-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are bought and paid for 😕

[10-Oct-18 10:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that was pretty obvious a fair while ago

[10-Oct-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
also jimmy song is not a large contributor to the codebase, is he? how is he become a leader?

[10-Oct-18 10:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its not jimmy song its /u/nullc answer

[10-Oct-18 10:41 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Nullc is Adam Back if i understand correctly

[10-Oct-18 10:47 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
From there to just say," just use a FDIC insured bank account, then you are not subject to volatility and will not have to deal with coinbase or bitpay ever again" it not far away

[10-Oct-18 10:50 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
All of that just because coinbase and bitpay support bch? Seriously ??

[10-Oct-18 10:59 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
It almost read like " bitcoin doesnt work right now, until then, please use legacy banking system, thank you"

[10-Oct-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
LN doesnt work I guess?

[10-Oct-18 11:00 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is the implicit statement

[10-Oct-18 11:01 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And when asked about why he concluded this: "because payment processors are traitors!"

[10-Oct-18 11:02 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And even after that, next statement was: " i dont know why people who have mentioned shitcoin names in their post history are questioning my arguments!"

[10-Oct-18 11:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
And farther down, "a 3 month old reddit account is questioning me.m, unacceptable!"

[10-Oct-18 11:03 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

How come a shitcoin like electroneum is overwhelmingly more popular and succesfull than kmd.
They offer a mobile miner and a wallet.. thats it.

Electroneum is no doubt a shitcoin, but their marketing, branding, art style, etc is more polished than KMD. Their wallets are easier to use (barely) and the concept is simpler for people to wrap their heads around.
