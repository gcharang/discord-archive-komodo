Whelp my backups didn't backup for HUSH/Pirate so enjoy the 10k/21k less supply in circulation everyone😅  :abusedsmily:

Thank you for your contribution

There's a lot of issues with the whole jl asset system but I will say Dex payout needs to return more than 5 percent of value per year for it to be better than kmd.

[20-Oct-19 03:54 PM] dan.#2473
Dexes in general have an uphill battle as the incentive to wash trade is much lower, which is where the majority of volume comes from on central exchanges

[20-Oct-19 03:55 PM] dan.#2473
Not to mention it would be much slower and much more difficult

[20-Oct-19 03:56 PM] dan.#2473
I personally see great utility in dexes but do not think they will have as much revenue as people hope

[20-Oct-19 04:04 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
liquidity will come with convenience, and a mobile app helps that a fair bit. The "not your keys" message gets louder at each CEX fail, and being immune to some of the more draconian regs from being a money transmitter puts limits on the CEX sector

[20-Oct-19 04:44 PM] joe2x4#5987
To be fair,  jl777 was one of the first crypto asset creators. NXT made this very easy. I believe he was trailblazing and providing reference of how a crypto asset could work. Jl777 also used his asset creation powers as an attempt to boost the supernet ico near the end of that offering if I remember right. Not a judgement thing just remembering some supernet history.

Is there a channel for commod?

[20-Oct-19 04:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
what is commod?

[20-Oct-19 04:53 PM] jspook16#3059
That's what I'm trying to find out

[20-Oct-19 04:53 PM] PHBA2061#2530
seems like a recently launched ac on Komodo <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5194266.0;topicseen>

[20-Oct-19 04:53 PM] jspook16#3059

[20-Oct-19 05:48 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Let's go BTC to 16k usd

[20-Oct-19 05:50 PM] cascrypto#8206
Eos?

[20-Oct-19 05:51 PM] cascrypto#8206
Most token volume is there

[20-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
why 16k @Gordon Komodo

[20-Oct-19 06:11 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I always thought that if we got past prev highs that 20k+ would be next?

[20-Oct-19 06:14 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Cryptoon theres no reason why it would just go straight to 20k

[20-Oct-19 06:14 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
its much more likely to hit various resistances on the way

[20-Oct-19 06:15 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
altho anything possible!

[20-Oct-19 06:15 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
like 2k also possible 😂

[20-Oct-19 06:17 PM] allbits#5898
@dan. your comparison of kmd five percent rewards to DEX fee rewards is absurd on its face. With kmd, the supply is increasing by five percent as you collect the rewards. The dex supply is basically fixed, so there is no concurrent dilution that goes along with dex rewards

[20-Oct-19 06:20 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@ChuckyEgg dunno, last bull run hardly any resistance past 11k to 20k or so

Anonymous: Bitcoin Will Hit $87,000 by November
An anonymous 4chan user who was spot on in his bitcoin price predictions so far this year, accurately hitting price targets, has predicted BTC will hit $87,000 in November of 2020.
 
 As first…

😄 @Cryptoon

[20-Oct-19 06:23 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
If enough people believe it, it might happen (they will make it happen)

[20-Oct-19 06:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ahhh yes the one prophecy that turned out to be true untill now 😄

[20-Oct-19 06:33 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Cryptoon have any 2 bull runs ever been the same?

[20-Oct-19 06:33 PM] dan.#2473
@allbits I don't think it's absurd. held DEX for a year until I envied KMD returns. 2 different types of income, but one is and has been a sure thing .

[20-Oct-19 06:34 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
btc is super bearish right now

[20-Oct-19 06:34 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
for reals dont listen to hopium moon boys

[20-Oct-19 06:34 PM] modereck#4269
any news?

[20-Oct-19 06:34 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
i believe it will go higher in the future but 87k is fantasy land if you are talking any time soon

[20-Oct-19 06:36 PM] Cryptoon#3362
dont think it's super bearish, but do believe in a pullback to the early 7k levels, maybe even 6500

[20-Oct-19 06:36 PM] Markus#5464
the anonymous person did not have right this time tho? btc most likely wont hit 16k this month and previous high of 14k is not 16k either

[20-Oct-19 06:36 PM] dan.#2473
This is the bottom

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but I see many people on cryptotwitter thinking it will go to 7300 - 6500 so maybe it wont come

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Cryptoon by super bearish i just mean it is much more likely to go down from here than up

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
i dont mean long term

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
so we agree

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Markus#5464
btc is actually pretty bullish on weekly

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
you cant pick one metric

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
confluence

[20-Oct-19 06:37 PM] Markus#5464
+ making a higher low on weekly aswell

[20-Oct-19 06:38 PM] Markus#5464
if it goes up from here we have also bullish divergence on weekly

[20-Oct-19 06:38 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
it keeps testing 8k region in very bearish macro structure

[20-Oct-19 06:38 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
the more times it tests that the more likely to break it

[20-Oct-19 06:49 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
as crypto investrs we all have an inherently bullish confirmation bias

[20-Oct-19 06:49 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
or i do anyway

[20-Oct-19 06:49 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
but it makes no sense

[20-Oct-19 07:00 PM] allbits#5898
@dan smh that you can't understand the simple point. KMD supply is diluted by almost the exact same five percent that you receive. It is not a comparable metric to dex reward. All your other points may be valid but on that one you are deceived by an appearance rather than a reality

[20-Oct-19 07:01 PM] Markus#5464
@allbits i think last time JL said that barely half of holders claim their reward

[20-Oct-19 07:02 PM] allbits#5898
Correct, the effective actual return might be one or two percent. Then that should be the comparable.

[20-Oct-19 07:02 PM] Markus#5464
👍

[20-Oct-19 07:17 PM] richardt#2807
@ChuckyEgg I agree.  Most people naturally have a bullish outlook on things they're invested in.  That's how most people lose money 😄

[20-Oct-19 07:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If people wouldnt have a bullish outlook, i hope they would be smart enough not to invest

[20-Oct-19 07:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
:p

[20-Oct-19 07:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The same reason play the lottery, every time they hope they will strike it big

[20-Oct-19 07:48 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you dont think you will/can win, why bother playing

[20-Oct-19 08:57 PM] dan.#2473
@allbits I will change my original statement of 5 percent, to whatever net benefit one gets from claiming monthly (let's say it is 1-2 percent), it isn't technically the full 5 whatever it is. Dex would need to outperform that for me

[20-Oct-19 09:10 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Cryptoon yes for sure, but i dont mean long term belief/bullishness in crypto, i mean short term bullishness in the moment, despite clear evidence the opposite is more likely

[20-Oct-19 09:11 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
like picking one metric that is bullish and ignoring 7 that arent

[20-Oct-19 09:11 PM] ChuckyEgg#0212
because the bullish metric makes them feel happy

[20-Oct-19 09:15 PM] allbits#5898
@dan. understood; very valid perspective

[21-Oct-19 03:26 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
@Cryptoon on an aside point most people who play the lottery do not think they will win

[21-Oct-19 03:26 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
they do it for the fantasy, the chance to dream about riches, etc

[21-Oct-19 03:27 AM] ChuckyEgg#0212
which is actually very similar to the reason many people (all of us to some extent?) invest in crypto

[21-Oct-19 06:16 AM] CoinKing88#1540
It all comes down to smartly go against the market at some point, like buying BTC @ 3.5K last year and selling near the top at 12-14K. Most people want to buy when its rising and high, and are scared to buy when its low, but that's where the money is (not only in crypto). Just use DCA and ladder in where you think the bottom is (you, and not the youtubers with their own interests).

[21-Oct-19 06:17 AM] CoinKing88#1540
You could or course be wrong and take a loss before making a profit but sticking to a plan makes that loss bearable.

[21-Oct-19 08:10 PM] Bittersweet#9376
@Markus btc is hanging in the middle of nowhere, fear of btc volatility is keeping alts down? My guess

[21-Oct-19 08:10 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I still think we see btc quite bit lower

[21-Oct-19 08:11 PM] Bittersweet#9376
And then 🌕

[21-Oct-19 08:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Btc below 7500 also good time to buy alts or first btc and then alts

[21-Oct-19 08:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or just immediately alts?

✅ 💯 

[21-Oct-19 09:57 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I have no idea, I think there will be a lot of fear near future btc lows in alts too

[21-Oct-19 10:00 PM] Bittersweet#9376
I'm just being safe with regular DCA strat

[21-Oct-19 10:00 PM] Bittersweet#9376
But I'm indulging in some trading between btc/alts

[22-Oct-19 01:50 AM] richardt#2807
@CoinKing88 That's exactly right.  Best strategy is to buy during the bear market and sell during the bull market.  Sounds easy, but not very easy to accomplish because the natural tendency is usually to do the opposite!

[22-Oct-19 01:55 AM] richardt#2807
During the 2014-2016 crypto bear market, all I did was buy and cost averaged down.  Needless to say, it paid off in 2017.  A similar thing could be happening right now from 2018-2020
