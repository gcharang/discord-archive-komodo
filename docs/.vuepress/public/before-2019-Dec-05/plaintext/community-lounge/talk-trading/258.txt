if in doubt blow it up

that is quite horrible...

On a side note if I used kmspico to crack windows cause I was a cheap bastard and nothing bad has happened so far, would it be possible for them to backdoor my ass or install malware? Say my version was “safe” and there was no previous keyloggers, worms etc. would there possibly be some open backdoor just waiting for the creator to use and mass hack everyone at once or target me?
Don’t know how computers or programs work LOL like is it safe now, safe forever

[01-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or there’s a good chance they hid something on purpose which they can use in the future whenever they choose to

[01-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or is kmspico generally regarded as safe and legit

Recently had my windows deactivated so looking to buy windows but not sure if should back everything up and format my hard drives

[01-Nov-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
once I saw a windows node connect to the internet for the first time. within seconds it was being bombarded with all sorts of packets, probing for weaknesses. I didnt stay around long enough to see how long before an unpatched exploit was exploited. It was like throwing fresh meat into a river full of hungry piranha. Ever since I never ever considered running a windows on anything

@Deleted User i had used kmspice to crack windows - but unfortunately my program zemana antilogger & malware antibytes have reported that this is malware

[01-Nov-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe in an airgapped environment it would stay ok for a while

that sounds scary

[01-Nov-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it was some years ago, before the problem really became bad

[01-Nov-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
and more years of exploits

[01-Nov-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, treat a windows node like testing. dont have any more coins on it that you are willing to lose

its not worth the risk using cracked windows etc. you can get a one time use key for like £5

How safe is mac compared to windows really?

[01-Nov-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
safer

[01-Nov-18 11:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I always heard there were just more virussen on windows as its actually used more

[01-Nov-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but still danger

And also, how much does an antivirus like mcafee or whatever really do on a system?

[01-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or is that just defending against general crap

[01-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And most stuff is generally useless against hackers etc

[01-Nov-18 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810

yes, all during the bear market people are approaching me to buy 10,000+ BTC. this entire doom and gloom is all part of the manipulation

[01-Nov-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
even if i had such BTC, I wouldnt be selling in the bear market

[01-Nov-18 12:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah i agree, I think the accumulation is happening in the background otc wise so not the directly affect the price till they are ready

[01-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
synchronized "bitcoin is dead" news, make otc buys at 5% below market price, sell off some in the open market to push the price down

[01-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
repeat

[01-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is incrementally profitable to do the above while accumulating

[01-Nov-18 12:58 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
The OTC market on bitcoin has been massive over the past months. Some estimate it does twice that on volume than standard exchange markets we go to.

[01-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i heard 3x or more

[01-Nov-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the vast majority of volumes are new money buying the old bitcoins from long time hodlers. the never ending fud does its work

[01-Nov-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810

Research: EOS is not a blockchain, it’s a glorified cloud comput...
A blockchain benchmarking firm, commissioned by ConsenSys, has made some pretty startling accusations: EOS is not really a blockchain.
https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F10%2Feosnotblockchain.jpg&signature=d493e252efe5712cc5b5b01d735a5537

[01-Nov-18 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
“EOS is not a blockchain, rather a distributed homogeneous database management system, a clear distinction in that their transactions are not cryptographically validated,”

[01-Nov-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
According to Cole, EOS stores all data related to transactions in a kind of table designed by lead EOS brain Dan Larimer, called a Chainbase.

When EOS network confirms transactions, Whiteblock claims block producers are simply cross-referencing new transactional data against this table, rather than confirming their legitimacy with cryptography.

The firm says EOS transactions only happen due to block producers updating the data stored in the underlying Chainbase, rather than cryptographically verified changes to the state of the underlying blockchain, as is the case with Ethereum.

“All of these actions operate in an environment that lacks cryptographic validation of the contracts and transactions,” says the research. “EOS is fundamentally the same as a centralized cloud computing architecture [client/server] without the fundamental components of a blockchain or peer-to-peer network.”

[01-Nov-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
8192 was the agreed number needed to reach 1 million transactions a second... the theoretical maximum is 1.2million... leaving plenty of room for error.

[01-Nov-18 03:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
due to block times, we may able to get higher than that ... depends, maybe AWS will let us have more CPU's now 😄

[01-Nov-18 03:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
also the MoMoM cross chain transactions, had a bug, which we will be testing the fix for in the next few days. If thats all good to go 🚀

They already forced my kids to have heaps of vaccinations, even though we didnt really want them to have that many, espeically for pointeless non lethal things, they threaten to not pay you if you dont, and wont let them go to school... So I figure if I just dont take their money anymore they can stop ordering me around like that, for decisions I can make for myself
