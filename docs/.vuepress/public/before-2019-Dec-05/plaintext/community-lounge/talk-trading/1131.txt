CVE-2019-12998, CVE-2019-12999, CVE-2019-13000 need a name/logo, so I humbly suggest: Ride The Lightning.

why Pirate Reijo buys ada? because I like platforms. I speculate that Hoskinson get things done. Great 20x btc leverage from ath. Best btc leverage in top 20 coins. I believe it can reach at least 4k sats/50% from previous ath in altseason with just hype. Why dgb? I like simple & fast payment cryptos like Nano too. Why not Link? Even if it was legit project, I wouldn't buy something with history chart looking like it's March 2018.

Trump is from point of europe great leader that speaks of problems that globalist elite try to destroy nationalism and culture from countries. If imigrant people can come to your country by EU elite just saying so and countries are forced to obey or face charges? Trump deserves lot credit from bringing out this globalist shit that has happened a lot during last 40 years. Example taxes torwards to china is thing that should have done when world trade deal was made. Why? Because it destroys working class in every country if you allow unfair competition in working costs.
