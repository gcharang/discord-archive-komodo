I think it will but it could take years

[10-Sep-19 12:42 AM] richardt#2807
before 2017, not a lot of people heard about crypto.  Now pretty much everybody knows about it to some degree

[10-Sep-19 12:42 AM] JimD#9272
the innovation that will drive the next bubble is being done now

[10-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
could be waiting 2-5 years

[10-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
BTC is gonna hit 20K again for sure

[10-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
and that will make people pretty greedy I think

[10-Sep-19 12:43 AM] JimD#9272
but who knows, maybe the BTC maximalists are right

[10-Sep-19 12:44 AM] JimD#9272
II'm placing my bets in any event

[10-Sep-19 12:46 AM] richardt#2807
I suppose anything is possible, but hoping for a coin with heavy bagholders to pump back to ATH is a likely a lost cause

[10-Sep-19 12:47 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, Im actually buying new bags at this point

[10-Sep-19 12:47 AM] JimD#9272
the question is if we are at the bottom and I think for the most part we have already hit the overall bottom

[10-Sep-19 12:50 AM] richardt#2807
From an investment standpoint, putting money in newer bags is likely to have better ROI if the goal is waiting for another altseason.  I guess DOGE and LTC are for some reason exceptions to that rule.  😄

btc maxis propaganda is so boring it takes all the interest away from cryptos.

[10-Sep-19 01:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
the eye of sauron is upon crypto now, expect every regulation in the book to be thrown at it until some kind of revolution happens.

The point of crypto was to be able to withstand those attacks

[10-Sep-19 01:03 AM] richardt#2807
@actionslacks yet another reason why altseason won't happen

[10-Sep-19 01:03 AM] JimD#9272
coins that are not decentralized will die

[10-Sep-19 01:03 AM] JimD#9272
no one is gonna be getting super rich anymore

[10-Sep-19 01:03 AM] JimD#9272
but it will still be around

[10-Sep-19 01:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
the issue isn't with crypto, it's with the humans who are scared to use it.

[10-Sep-19 01:04 AM] JimD#9272
well when their governments don't provide them with sound money they might get more interested

[10-Sep-19 01:05 AM] JimD#9272
and the automation of the finance industry should give some other use cases

[10-Sep-19 01:05 AM] JimD#9272
trustless transactions are not going away

[10-Sep-19 01:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
In the coming cashless society, It will likely be the only way out to steer clear of total control.

[10-Sep-19 01:07 AM] JimD#9272
Ahh yes, the progressive society where everyone is essentially just a slave but thinks are free because they can walk around with a gay flag in a G-string

[10-Sep-19 01:10 AM] richardt#2807
I think it will take generations before crypto is used in everyday life because society will need to change the way it thinks about money/transfer of value.  Like said, probably will require a revolution of some sort.

[10-Sep-19 01:10 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1169947852623290369?s=20 boring crap like this drives people away. We need to make blockchain and alts fun again. We need to able to change their narrative to more approachable for gen public.

The revolution will be funded with crypto

[10-Sep-19 01:11 AM] richardt#2807
Honestly, the best way to secure a crypto future is to teach kids about it (or brainwash them :D)

[10-Sep-19 01:11 AM] JimD#9272
Teach them about the fiat money system

[10-Sep-19 01:11 AM] JimD#9272
that was more than enough for me

[10-Sep-19 01:12 AM] richardt#2807
it's near impossible to change thinking of current people who are in charge, make policies/regulations, and could bring crypto mainstream

[10-Sep-19 01:12 AM] JimD#9272
The longer crypto goes the more the kids will see it as normal

[10-Sep-19 01:13 AM] JimD#9272
Parents can start paying their kids allowances in nano

[10-Sep-19 01:13 AM] richardt#2807
exactly, kids growing up these days can't imagine a world without computers/phones

[10-Sep-19 01:13 AM] richardt#2807
hopefully kids growing up in the future will think the same way with crypto

[10-Sep-19 01:14 AM] JimD#9272
Ya, I think it will catch on at some point but don't expect the credit card companies or global finance not to go down without a fight

[10-Sep-19 01:14 AM] JimD#9272
any functionality that crypto can provide can be mimicked easily by a centralized system

[10-Sep-19 01:15 AM] JimD#9272
so people just need to understand why decentralization is important imho

[10-Sep-19 01:15 AM] JimD#9272
someone start writing crypto kids books

[10-Sep-19 01:24 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
the establishment is trying to make crypto all about stablecoins and kyc/aml laws. Every bigger corp want to make their own libras now. Regulated crypto space is like a nightmare already. God I wish kmd can make atomicdex perfect. Support every stablecoin and it's game over for banking cartel.

Bob was missing Alice so he sent 50sats for a shuttle she will be at Bob's by 8.30. Here she comes,  she is still in bed sleeping, I think I will leave till later, she won't be happy if I wake her thought Bob. Pirate Reijo turned up, did I see Alice coming here, he said? You do know that if she comes to my gaff knobody would know because I'm private. What about the banking cartell said Bob, what about them it's my business not theirs replied Reijo. Lucky7 turned up and said you do know the bank cartell is alreaddy dead through zimbabway economics.

With the current state of things, I see DEX as the most promising out of all KMD tech

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Sep-19 01:41 AM] richardt#2807
IMO, KMD should throw the most time/resources at developing and marketing it instead of trying to be a jack of all trades

[10-Sep-19 01:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Dex is just the engine ,  all the pieces together make the car

[10-Sep-19 01:53 AM] Nev#5914
Yeah I like the car.

[10-Sep-19 01:54 AM] Nev#5914
A car that runs on digits

[10-Sep-19 01:56 AM] richardt#2807
I should clarify - I meant DEX as in the product, i.e. AtomicDEX

[10-Sep-19 01:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
As far as products go it will be first to market,  already started coin integrations and have many interested parties for whitelabel and api integration.  The composer will be marketed later still very early with that one but in the meantime trying to get it on the other big cloud providers.

[10-Sep-19 01:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Set the stage

[10-Sep-19 02:00 AM] richardt#2807
that's good to hear.  It should really be the focus

[10-Sep-19 02:08 AM] Nev#5914
So when this stage is set what would that mean anybody can get on it and do their stuff, yeah.

[10-Sep-19 02:11 AM] Nev#5914
tThere will be a but, but it will only be about desireto get on the stage.

[10-Sep-19 02:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It would give us leverage regarding marketing and distribution of the composer.

[10-Sep-19 02:25 AM] Nev#5914
Composer being metaphorical for a Bob and Alice block chain building kit.

[10-Sep-19 02:26 AM] Nev#5914
Could I build a centralized block chain with this composer?

[10-Sep-19 02:26 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes

[10-Sep-19 02:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Well currently via CLI, the composer , which is the GUI and deployment system for chains doesn’t have it available yet.  Or at least last I checked.  To run a centralized chain, would be akin to running a Komodo but where a single party controlled all the notaries

[10-Sep-19 02:30 AM] Nev#5914
I was thinking somebody might want one a group or something but the notaries answers it, thanks.

•it needs HHs&HLs
