well they will need KYC soon

I only use kyc exchanges because I'm not a criminal  money laundering terrorist.

no pump, btc stole the show again

@actionslacks till they get hacked by blackhats, now they know where you live and how much crypto you have

[12-Jul-19 07:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
I'm fairly certain I'm not worth the effort. I would enjoy meeting some new people though. 🤗🔪🔫

[12-Jul-19 07:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
thats is a great point though @hyperDEX. the govt is essentially forcing people to potentially put their lives in danger and trust random crypto exchange operators with their identities.

[12-Jul-19 08:53 AM] Malti#3948
I always had my eye on Ark and Stratis next to Komodo as they are also more than a cryptocurrency (aiming for ecosystem/BaaS). Stratis used to be a top 20 coin iirc and Ark mostly floating around KMD.. Looking at those now, STRAT spot 99 and ARK  spot 122... 

KMD keeping that top 50 spot pretty consistently is an undervalued fact imo..

[12-Jul-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
considering there have been literally thousands of new projects in the last 2 years, indeed, maintaining the ~50 ranking is indeed quite an underrated achievement. former top 20 projects typically end up on page 2 or 3 or 4, unless they have a lot of support. as poorly as STRAT and ARK seem to have done, it is much better than coins like BLK, XCP and so many others. and of course with KMD actually climbing the ranks, it is a very power sign

[12-Jul-19 08:59 AM] Malti#3948
agreed, that's why I take the example of ARK and STRAT as they are not your typical 'shitcoins' that actually deserve to fade away

[12-Jul-19 08:59 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c will there be a new roadmap 15th?

[12-Jul-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly when BTC is going up steeply, the fiat arb bots smash all the altcoin prices and it might be my imagination but the altcoins sells seems to happen a little BEFORE the BTC going up.

[12-Jul-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that can only happen if the BTC pumpers are the altcoin dumpers

[12-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
@Markus i am not familiar with this "roadmap" term, is it some marketing thing?

[12-Jul-19 09:00 AM] Malti#3948
people just get locked in in KMD

[12-Jul-19 09:00 AM] Malti#3948
they come and have a look, see what is happening and don't leave

[12-Jul-19 09:00 AM] Markus#5464
its like a picture of goals to be reached

[12-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
how exactly am i supposed to make a roadmap of future solutions, like nSPV that just come out of nowhere?

[12-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Malti#3948
I guess all will be clear in 3(!) days :Komodo:

[12-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Markus#5464
well ye sure make sense i quess but does kmd not have any sort of mile stones ?

[12-Jul-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you have to ask the big lizard

[12-Jul-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i only do the cli stuff, which most people dont really care about

[12-Jul-19 09:01 AM] Malti#3948
I thought you just stood up one day and decided nSPV had to be created? 😉

[12-Jul-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
actually i was reading the flyclient mathpaper, or trying to, and instead of deciphering what all the complex math was, it just seemed easier to create a simple solution to the same problem

[12-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
such events cannot be planned for, nor predicted

[12-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i do however have a history of solving problems

[12-Jul-19 09:03 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c what is kmds goal then? i mean to me it seems like kmd is expanding in every possible corner, gaming, wallets and what not

[12-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
goal?

[12-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
solving the ultimate issue that faces crypto

[12-Jul-19 09:04 AM] Markus#5464
Alright

[12-Jul-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
achieving global adoption without being regulated to death, which requires not only tech, but the proper tech that is immune from regulations. luckily the fully decentralized model is both. it is 1000x+ harder to make fully decentralized solutions, which is why it takes so long, but now there is enough infrastructure in place to be able to solve all the remaining issues

[12-Jul-19 09:05 AM] Markus#5464
I think dpow is a really clever thing but do u ever think of a even better solution that would protect in similar way but not having to spend btc?

[12-Jul-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
without spending BTC, you cant get BTC transactions

[12-Jul-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
without BTC transactions, you cannot benefit from BTC hashrate

[12-Jul-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
once a problem is solved satisfatorily, then i dont spend much time trying to improve it more, especially as there are many areas that dont have any solutions at all yet

[12-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Markus#5464
true thats why i meant are u ever considering some alternative solution that gives similar lvl of protection but does not have to do with btc?

[12-Jul-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing comes close to BTC security. nothing

[12-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Markus#5464
Ok

[12-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Malti#3948
and isn't dPoW 'swapable'? imagine LTC would take over, KMD can notarize to the LTC chain right?

[12-Jul-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
once all the various parts are all in place and there is a viable full spectrum solution, then the weakest link can be improved and this process iterated

[12-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Malti#3948
could we notarize to a PoS chain if needed?

[12-Jul-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the destination chain wont be hard to change as long as it is a bitcoin protocol. but if you are waiting for LTC (or even BCH) to overtake BTC... you have many years (decades) as it is extremely unlikely

[12-Jul-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with PoS chains is there is no external reference

[12-Jul-19 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all self-referential

[12-Jul-19 09:08 AM] Malti#3948
anyway, the problem isn't here right now

[12-Jul-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so with a PoS chain, everything will be ok, until a catastrophic failure. PoW fails in a predictable 51% attack way, which are bad, but transitory. a PoS chain once compromised, stays compromised

[12-Jul-19 09:10 AM] Malti#3948
hmm, correct. Never thought if this.

[12-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and since the entire point of dPoW is to add as much security as possible, having a failure mode being a total catastrophic failure in the secure chain it seems unwise

[12-Jul-19 09:11 AM] Malti#3948
Do you get excited over the marketing campaign in any way? Isn't it nice to see all the tech you and the team have created communicated in a new way?

[12-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the video is very cool

[12-Jul-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
glad that more people can understand the scope of what is already achieved

[12-Jul-19 09:12 AM] Malti#3948
cool, happy to hear

[12-Jul-19 09:13 AM] Markus#5464
Which other project do u think could be a competitor to kmd?

[12-Jul-19 09:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
no one

[12-Jul-19 09:13 AM] Lumbi#8378
Is it not a maximalist worldview to think in terms of monopolistic 'mass adoption'? what is wrong with a multitude of independent, parallel systems?

[12-Jul-19 09:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
when is winblows competitor to open source like linux

[12-Jul-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it isnt so unexpected but it seems a majority of people still view KMD as just a zcash fork privacy coin. so when the rebranding takes effect and people realize that KMD has totally transformed itself, we could indeed see a totally different market perception of it

[12-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
@Lumbi when did i ever say mass adoption would happen with a single system?

[12-Jul-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly global mass adoption cannot rely on a single blockchain, else its failure is like a centralized cloudfare blocking 42% of the internet

[12-Jul-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
with komodo, unlimited numbers of systems can be created to both allow mass market scaling, while at the same time be immune from any single system failure. we do need to get more source level forks for true immunity, but there are already a few such networks and once there is a proliferation of such chains, then it truly becomes unstoppable. any single component could be disabled at any given time, but not across all the systems

[12-Jul-19 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it is open source and a lot of projects are already copying what we do. in the larger sense that is a good thing, gives the crypto ecosystem more resilience, while solving the mass adoption problem in a practical way

[12-Jul-19 09:20 AM] Markus#5464
What would it take to overload the kmd blockchain and can it be a possible threat in the future if millions of ppl  start to transact on kmd daily?

[12-Jul-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and all the traders wanting some KMD tax to monetize this ... i guess some long term ecosystem explanation doesnt make sense to them? yet, how many silicon valley companies run at losses of billions for years, just to build up userbase. so think of KMD as in the building userbase stage. once we have a sufficient number of users, then monetizations can be added in ways that dont affect the user experience too much

[12-Jul-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
we can always spin up KMD sidechains if the KMD usages becomes too big and blocks are getting full (after doubling blocksize again)

[12-Jul-19 09:21 AM] Markus#5464
ok

[12-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
what about google?

[12-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
how much did they charge for searches?

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] Malti#3948
is it?

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
imaging their current marketshare if each search cost money

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] Malti#3948
how long were they making losses?

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
uber is still losing billions

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] Malti#3948
and they IPO'd

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
google spent many years without any revenues

[12-Jul-19 09:24 AM] Malti#3948
blows my mind

[12-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the model of komodo is to gain userbase as much as possible, and then figure out ways of monetizing in the optimal way. like for atomicDEX, we give KMD a 10% discount on the dexfee

[12-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a benefit for using KMD

[12-Jul-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
instead of a tax for using KMD

[12-Jul-19 09:26 AM] Malti#3948
so during the tech development, you are actively thinking about the monetization question as well?

[12-Jul-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
when you are driving across many countries, do you worry much about what parking spot you will use after you are done driving the thousands of km?

[12-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Malti#3948
lol, how do you come up with these comparisons 😆

[12-Jul-19 09:27 AM] Malti#3948
but okay, true

[12-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
you asked, it is what came to mind. likely colored by the earlier roadmap question

[12-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
what is monetization?

[12-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just adding some fee to an action that users perform, right?

[12-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Malti#3948
that's one way

[12-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Malti#3948
or selling data

[12-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so the value of monetization is sum across all time of useractions *fee

[12-Jul-19 09:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
I think google did have a rather low burn rate in its first years (can't cite numbers right now)

[12-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly we wont be selling the data that we are not gathering

[12-Jul-19 09:29 AM] Malti#3948
I know, but fees are not the only way to make money, that was just my point 😃

[12-Jul-19 09:30 AM] Malti#3948
(can I take that bit to make a tweet?)

[12-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so the difficulty of adding monetization is the difficulty of adding a vout -> fee address to transactions that users make, in a way that users can accept as reasonable and not reduce usage

[12-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is literally a few hours work to add and test

[12-Jul-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
compared to the years of work it takes to build userbase

[12-Jul-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you add fees before there is a big userbase, it most likely will prevent you from getting any big userbase

[12-Jul-19 09:31 AM] Malti#3948
that is true

[12-Jul-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why EOS gets the usage it gets as it is free for users, but they charge the developers and arm and a leg or two

[12-Jul-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
with komodo, the users might be charged fees or not, it is up to each project, but usually whatever fee would be denominated in a relatively low cost coin

[12-Jul-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and out of all the various projects, the best ones will rise to the top

[12-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Malti#3948
so basically the strategy is: get as much people as possible on board and then you'll figure out how to monetize

[12-Jul-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
in the gold rush, the only guaranteed way to make money is to cater to the gold miners. some gold miners will strike it big, most wont. no way to tell ahead of time. so we make the platform that allows people the best chance of success and in turn the ecosystem will get the big successful projects
