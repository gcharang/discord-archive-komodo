@Alright so much to read up already in staked. I always thought staked was about the PoS thing that was originally started for chips?

[10-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I manged to pick more at 16.5 k sats so Im happy 😄

[10-Sep-18 08:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hopefully I will have some more time after this week to read up and see what it’s all about

[10-Sep-18 08:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Question is whether or not we will see 5.5k ish like mid august

[10-Sep-18 08:28 PM] jorian#4555
some say ETH will go as low as $50

[10-Sep-18 08:28 PM] jorian#4555
that's a long way down

[10-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem for eth is that its price was fueled during the ico craze

[10-Sep-18 08:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Now that everything is going to shit, what is the reason for eth to exist even? 5$ smart contracts? No thx

[10-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Buddz1993#5380
yep thats the problem with eth

[10-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Buddz1993#5380
I think 5,5k is possible for btc

[10-Sep-18 08:34 PM] Buddz1993#5380
but we keep forming higher lows so idk

[10-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
in my best dreams I see eth going down and Komodo replacing it up in top 2 😄

[10-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Buddz1993#5380
those are wildest dreams obviously ahah

[10-Sep-18 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Sep-18 09:45 PM] Buddz1993#5380
ye 50 $ even in one year seems reasonable 😄

[11-Sep-18 01:41 AM] jspook16#3059
this year?

[11-Sep-18 01:53 AM] bishop#9773
The bar is too high, lower it

[11-Sep-18 01:54 AM] jspook16#3059
$1.64 this year

[11-Sep-18 02:10 AM] bishop#9773
Too high, aim lower

[11-Sep-18 02:11 AM] jspook16#3059
$0.21

[11-Sep-18 02:11 AM] bishop#9773
That's the stuff

[11-Sep-18 02:11 AM] bishop#9773
Gainz :trollface:

[11-Sep-18 02:11 AM] jspook16#3059
lol better believe i'll be taking out loans if it gets that low

[11-Sep-18 02:12 AM] bishop#9773
I did loans when Darkcoin was $2

[11-Sep-18 02:12 AM] jspook16#3059
how did that work out?

[11-Sep-18 02:12 AM] bishop#9773
fine

[11-Sep-18 02:13 AM] jspook16#3059
anybody else mining dsec?

[11-Sep-18 03:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
If we ever hit 20c, we won’t. Because I’ll be buying all the way down ✌️

[11-Sep-18 03:42 AM] jspook16#3059
Lol

[11-Sep-18 03:56 AM] Buddz1993#5380
I said 50$ in one year meaning end of 2019 or beginning of 2020.

[11-Sep-18 06:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I can live with that

[11-Sep-18 06:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But I’d rather see a ton of usage through dpow/cc/dico for third parties

[11-Sep-18 06:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Price will follow

[11-Sep-18 09:53 AM] sφldat#8733
20$ end 2019

[11-Sep-18 09:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
It's always darkest before the dawn my friends. At least the "Bitcoin is Dead" talk has subsided. Crypto will never disappear, It will only only grow in fits and and starts until it becomes the supreme method of exchange.

[11-Sep-18 09:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
Christmas 2013 felt a little similar

[11-Sep-18 10:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
to Christmas 2017

[11-Sep-18 10:27 AM] snowdamn#2414
yes, don't hear "Bitcoin is Dead" much

[11-Sep-18 10:28 AM] snowdamn#2414
but i wonder if we're losing ground on the "Bitcoin will go higher than $20k" crowd

[11-Sep-18 10:28 AM] snowdamn#2414
?

[11-Sep-18 10:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
Only when the house of cards comes tumbling down. That will be the true birth of crypto

I just have to lol at how the EOS community bring "solutions" to their problems https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/9erevb/starteos_is_consistently_the_worst_performing_bp/e5rg9z4

A BP is not "bahaving"? Just lock the voters funds for a month!

[11-Sep-18 11:06 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Next thing will be: does your account give signs of compulsive/addicitive gambling? Lets lock your account for a year to "protect you from yourself".

[11-Sep-18 11:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah EOS... the PayPal of crypto

[11-Sep-18 11:16 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if ETH brought false expectations to the crypto space, EOS will bring a lot more.

[11-Sep-18 11:19 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
first false expectation is "free transactions"

[11-Sep-18 11:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
Yeah and judging by the architectural problems inherent in ETH,  EOS is gonna be a bloodbath if and when it blows up for real usage wise

[11-Sep-18 11:30 AM] actionslacks#4072
But who knows, maybe some other project is just inherently better poised to handle the coming hordes. If you find one lmk😏

[11-Sep-18 11:32 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
This is what will happen.

[11-Sep-18 11:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Devs will let people use their dapps with "free transactions" just to attract the masses.

[11-Sep-18 11:33 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Once the masses are within the system... they will start charging for everything.

[11-Sep-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i wonder how big the internet would have become with a payment per use model

[11-Sep-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
for mass market, my guess is it needs to be unlimited usage for some reasonable monthly fee, like the ISP model evolved to

[11-Sep-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
all the investors wanting their coin to lock in users with big fees, it seems quite misguided

[11-Sep-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
in the early years you want to capture marketshare with minimal friction

{Reactions}
💯 

[11-Sep-18 11:36 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
The problem i see with this model is that the more mass public you attract, the more it will cost for everyone... somthing that is somewhat contrary in the current system.

[11-Sep-18 11:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Also it is so early in the game for them and already you see the basic cultural poison of democracy

[11-Sep-18 11:39 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is using the vote as punishment.

[11-Sep-18 11:42 AM] actionslacks#4072
EOS' theory states that benevolent "interested" parties will work for the good of the greater whole, which has fallen flat on it's face multiple times already

[11-Sep-18 11:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
ETH's "turing complete" programmable money theory has only demonstrated that the GAS model doesn't work.

[11-Sep-18 11:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
and that you can eviscerate hundreds of millions in real wealth with an unhandled exception

[11-Sep-18 11:45 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
the problem is that it has taken a couple of years and a couple billion dollars to understand this...

[11-Sep-18 11:46 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and now the same thing is being done with EOS...

[11-Sep-18 11:47 AM] actionslacks#4072
I wonder what it feels like to be the guy that locked away to everyone millions of dollars forever with a line of code

[11-Sep-18 11:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
what a world

[11-Sep-18 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
I see a big push in the discourse that a chain without "governance" is no good

[11-Sep-18 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
POS chains are being favored because "governance"... something that is not directly related, but still people repeat it.

[11-Sep-18 11:51 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
IMO governance is need in blockchains that have a broken model 😂

[11-Sep-18 11:52 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is like... yeah... the system can be cheated since i did these changes.... so, let "governance" take care of it.

[11-Sep-18 11:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
exactly. pow works because the only value given is earned. pure capitalism. not crony capitalism.

#talk-other-topics

[11-Sep-18 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
not necesarily offtopic

[11-Sep-18 11:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
Crypto is defining a new governance model. it's completely without ideology or precedent. I think democratically elected nodes are a stopgap until a new concept is actualized. but It's progress nonetheless

[11-Sep-18 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Its talking about where the market is putting its weight

[11-Sep-18 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
and it looks like the same irrational stupidity reigns

[11-Sep-18 11:57 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
imo these are at the same time the same issues that will eventually tild the pendullum of the market.

[11-Sep-18 12:00 PM] actionslacks#4072
the market is idiotic at best.

[11-Sep-18 12:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the market is idiotic at best.`
Isn't that a given?

[11-Sep-18 12:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
It speaks more to the human condition and how malleable the human mind is

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
our society, history, and education is pure manipulation

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
market is always irrational.

☝🏿 

[11-Sep-18 12:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but the irrationality is a pendullum... it does tilt the other way eventually

[11-Sep-18 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
In a "rational world", BTC could never be perceived as "doing poorly" at "only" 13.7x what it was 28 or 29 months ago....

[11-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Markus#5464
what are your guys price prediction of btc and kmd  end of december this year?

[11-Sep-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_knows better than to try to predict 30 days out, much less **any** December_

[11-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Markus#5464
Do u think Bakkt gonna have a positive or negative impact of the price?

[11-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
The price will definitely be >0

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
buy whatever sounds the most retarded and is being shilled the hardest on /biz/

[11-Sep-18 12:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
then sell as soon as you realized <5% gains before it gets epicly dumped

[11-Sep-18 12:22 PM] actionslacks#4072
'how I made my riches'

[11-Sep-18 12:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Or better yet, get into political power in china and threaten to regulate crypto right after taking a short position on popular exchanges

[11-Sep-18 12:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
then buy real estate in Canada, USA, and Australia... rinse and repeat until real world domination

[11-Sep-18 12:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
Seriously though, no one realizes that we could change the world tomorrow if we really wanted to. We have the tech and the bandwidth and the devices.
