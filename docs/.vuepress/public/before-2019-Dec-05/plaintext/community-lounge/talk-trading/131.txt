I guess i never heard of it yet. (a bit off topic, but does komodo prevent someone from creating an asset chain with the same name as an existing chain?)

[04-Sep-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no

[04-Sep-18 02:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the supply is diffrent, and it uses diff params it wont "find" the other chain at any time.

[04-Sep-18 02:04 AM] jspook16#3059
@blackjok3r could that be problem?

[04-Sep-18 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
if you change any of the ac_ parameters, it changes the coin's magic value

[04-Sep-18 02:04 AM] Alright#0419
magic value being what determines the ports it uses

[04-Sep-18 02:05 AM] Alright#0419
so `-ac_name=DEX -ac_supply=999999` and `-ac_name=DEX -ac_supply=1000000` would be two completely different coins and their nodes would never interact

[04-Sep-18 02:06 AM] jspook16#3059
ok just curious about that. what about the faucetget.....does it work like my comment above?

[04-Sep-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
`faucetget` will output a raw tx that is spending a CC vout from the contract and sending part of it to yourself

[04-Sep-18 02:07 AM] Alright#0419
you then broadcast it

[04-Sep-18 02:08 AM] Alright#0419
That's the basis for a lot of the contracts. There are coins in a contract address with the special vout type "CryptoCondition". Anyone can spend them, but these spends must fit the rules laid out by the contract

[04-Sep-18 02:14 AM] jspook16#3059
Im starting to wrap my head around CC. When is going to be enabled in kmd?

Something or other, I’ve butchered those quotes enough for one night

@jspook16 plan is next year's hard fork when the notaries change I believe

[04-Sep-18 02:19 AM] jspook16#3059
the documentation implies that you can start writing up CCs in /komodo/src/cc/

[04-Sep-18 02:20 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, then you can test them on an asset chain with ac_cc

[04-Sep-18 02:23 AM] jspook16#3059
Understood. What can the common folks (non team members) do for the CC effort? it sounds like jl and team will code most of the necessary CCs for the ecosystem,

[04-Sep-18 02:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
fuck it started raining and there is a hole in my roof 😦

Some good stuff posted here tonight

[04-Sep-18 05:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Always good waking up reading up on some #talk-trading wisdom

[04-Sep-18 05:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Regarding the whale, I still really dont think its the silkroad whale and we should refrain from spreading that message. As said above its obviously someone/a group that went through the kyc process and I highly doubt someone with ties to the silk road wallets would do that.

[04-Sep-18 06:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or they just got some hacked/unverified accounts and mass bought then transferred to themselves 😂

[04-Sep-18 06:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But, still those btc would be flagged and the feds probably already gave a list to centralized exchanges to block the amounts coming from those adresses?

[04-Sep-18 06:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I dunno, maybe I’m thinking too highly of the fbi or whatever, but I’m pretty sure those btc are tracked closely

[04-Sep-18 06:26 AM] jorian#4555
anyone tracking jumblr fees? 😛

[04-Sep-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
someone said it was loaded with KMD earlier.

august 17 last fee

[04-Sep-18 07:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is the fee paid in the end or during the process?

[04-Sep-18 07:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Probs during

[04-Sep-18 07:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe some processes have started and we will only see the result in a week or so

[04-Sep-18 07:22 AM] actionslacks#4072

seems like we need some more beer and pizza

[04-Sep-18 07:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe do a cc thing once it's active

[04-Sep-18 07:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
read the github guide, maybe port cc to an app like ca333 did for beerdex?

[04-Sep-18 07:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
in any case dont know if its a pump or recognition of competence but KMD back in the top 50 is remarkable

[04-Sep-18 07:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
so congrats everyone

[04-Sep-18 07:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED will be good for this, I figured out how to use te dice game pretty muc perfectly, hopefully we can make a simple GUI for that soon. Its a fun game, even if you can never win it.

[04-Sep-18 07:39 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah i'm anxious to play around with the faucet. I just remember the competition being a really good motivator for me personally. we should consider doing another one based on the impending features.

[04-Sep-18 07:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
new KMD whale should not forget PIRATE 😁

[04-Sep-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
STAKED is already that, but the learning curve is quite steep.

[04-Sep-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its all CLI based

[04-Sep-18 07:40 AM] actionslacks#4072
wheres the whale?

binance?

[04-Sep-18 07:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r great! I'll be contacting you soon on dice UI soon after I have the basic done for assets GUI

[04-Sep-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries 👍

[04-Sep-18 07:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
I got some harpoons

[04-Sep-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I figured I would use staked to make simple cli based dapps that use the CC RPC's then pass it on to GUi people to save them some time.

[04-Sep-18 07:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you can figure things out from bash, I'm pretty sure you can be a decent compiled programming language progammer too 🙂

[04-Sep-18 07:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
pick some and join the core devs

[04-Sep-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need to move to python for it I think, bash is strting to have too many limitations

[04-Sep-18 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
python compiles to a binary code?

[04-Sep-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure but its easier to code

[04-Sep-18 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it's like ruby or node.js

[04-Sep-18 07:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for interfacing to RPC and parseing json its a LOT better

[04-Sep-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
than bash and jq

[04-Sep-18 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yeah that's true

[04-Sep-18 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
good at least you didn't pick node.js 😄

I used backbone with node for json and its bretty good

[04-Sep-18 07:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
