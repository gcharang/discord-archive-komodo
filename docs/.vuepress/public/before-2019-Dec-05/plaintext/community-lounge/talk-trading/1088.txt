@tolken What about China? KMD hasn't penetrated the asian markets.

@PTYX just fuckin with ya, I thought that wwould be obvious when two words were promised, but only one delivered. Seriously though, Redfox and followers keep teasing about China via twitter, no idea what they’re talking about.

Dear whale, youre doing it wrong.  Youre supposed to be selling 300000 KMD.  KMD is not ever allowed to go up.

[23-Aug-19 08:17 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Feels weird to see it go up

[23-Aug-19 08:20 AM] Alexfrog#1338
KMD is s 75 cent stablecoin heading to being a 50 cent stablecoin.  Not allowed to ever increase in value.  So stable.

Would be nice to see kmd doing a 30% day like other alts do too

[23-Aug-19 08:25 AM] CoinKing88#1540
That would get the interest of traders going and is good for volume

1 big move of btc and we back to 7k range in a heartbeat

[23-Aug-19 08:28 AM] Alexfrog#1338
alts?  what are you talking about.  BTC will be the only coin and fees will be $10000 per send

[23-Aug-19 08:28 AM] CoinKing88#1540
But green is always nice to see on a friday

[23-Aug-19 08:31 AM] actionslacks#4072
you can go on Coinbene, put a highish bid and the bots will move to your price. not sure how much to go up 30% but it's probably just a few btc. child's play.

[23-Aug-19 08:34 AM] CoinKing88#1540
Orderbook is pretty shallow anyway on binance, sells up to 10k only 16btc total

[23-Aug-19 08:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
it was a 10btc wall at 7.77k sats last week, now it's 25btc at 8k sats. seems like an experiment.

Weird that trades went through on bitmax. I would figure it isnt that hard to put some simple protection in place (if BTC price deviated more that x% from source A, B and C then all trading halts or something?)

For all of those that feel hope is lost for #altseason.. Its not.. Its not at all.. Remember, EVERYTHING in life is cyclical.  THis chart has followed the same (cycle) trend for 6 years.. Lets keep it going another 3 years!!! THis chart indicates, a bounce is on the horizo...

I noticed a whole flurry of new altcoin exchanges- interesting, hopefully a cpl of these last a bit longer than the dead ones like craptsy, cryptopia etc..

[23-Aug-19 07:31 PM] actionslacks#4072
i noticed that as well. And the majority of alt's volume is going through non kyc exchanges. All of these potential criminals, such a shame.

[23-Aug-19 07:42 PM] altcoinist#1501
@actionslacks  why would criminals use unstable cryptocurrencies instead of cash?

[23-Aug-19 07:45 PM] actionslacks#4072
because their trying to impress the ladies with their Leeet h4x. Everyone knows chicks love crypto.

the majority non-kyc alt volume is a bullish environment for kmd's mobile dex release.

I don't want to burst any bubbles, but to my knowledge @Oliver Westbrook had Veruscoin (strictly speaking also a ZCASH fork) running on his Pi4 some time ago already. Also on a ARM arch developed by @radix42 ...

[23-Aug-19 08:28 PM] radix42#3743
was it a pi?
