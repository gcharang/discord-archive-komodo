they have a general N,K impl, not sure which blackjoker used, but i think it's that

reading thru, it supports arbitrary N,K, methinks

[19-Apr-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe all combos already works?

[19-Apr-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the max values for each

[19-Apr-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
did blackjoker use that code?

[19-Apr-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
4 bytes max each

[19-Apr-19 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
normal ints

[19-Apr-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
he said he ported beam miner

[19-Apr-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so crazy things like 1343,42 can be used?

this is the only relevant information in that file, as most of the rest are miner itself. if you plan to implement a pool support with it, basically validator is the only needed

i wonder what the RAM usage is

[19-Apr-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c those params would need more RAM than most computers that exist have

[19-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
would make it ASIC resistant

[19-Apr-19 10:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
so resistant

[19-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
would need to use VM

[19-Apr-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
NVME mining

[19-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Ondalf#1318
https://github.com/s-nomp/equihashverify/blob/master/crypto/equihash.cpp#L725-L771
then when we look at this; isn't it the same? basically, s-nomp has the support for it already.

might get a compile time or run-time memory allocation error, trying to find one PoW solution

[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Ondalf#1318
definitions for the solvers defaults follows after those bits

[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so pools can support it without much problems, that is good

[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Ondalf#1318
@jl777c yep

[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c are (N,K) params that can only run on TOP500 supercomputers "asic-resistant" ?

[19-Apr-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
how much RAM is actually needed?

[19-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
setup NVME with VM, wont need a supercomputer

[19-Apr-19 10:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
(150,5) needs 3.8 GB

[19-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so a few TB?

[19-Apr-19 10:22 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`basically, s-nomp has the support for it already.` so does knomp and z-nomp

[19-Apr-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
an interesting thing, NVME mining would be the only practical

wish there was any logic with 96,5 VRAM usage.... 6273MiB say nvidia-smi now

[19-Apr-19 10:24 AM] Ondalf#1318
i mean, it usually means, the lower the numbers, the lower the usage, right? but this seems doing 180deg opposite

[19-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems just this feature would be worth highlighting once we get it fully validated

[19-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe lower is bigger?

192 and 144 confirms or sidelines that pretty well

[19-Apr-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c sure does feel like KMD world needs an asset chain that does (150,5)

[19-Apr-19 10:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
new ASICs are being developed for (150,5) as well, supposedly

[19-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe BTCH

[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c smart man

[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
The irony is the RAM question is why I despise so many of the "movements" using certain values to drop ASICs, because they drop a slew of GPU miners in the process and limit it to only certain GPUs, thereby nullifying their own logic

[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
we would need -ac_switch_NK=from:to

[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
its all about having the coin algo match the hardware you have!

[19-Apr-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess using the definition of "decentralization" where it means "whatever hardware I have is decentralized, anything else is centralized"

[19-Apr-19 10:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
all my opinions about mining changed when I got my first FPGA, you are correct @jl777c

[19-Apr-19 10:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
BTCH going to (150,5) sounds vaguely interesting

[19-Apr-19 10:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
(150,5) + 50% PoS would be what it migrates to, that would balance things

[19-Apr-19 10:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
no way to add mining to BTCH without increasing supply, and the super simplest thing that works is doubling it to 42M, which I call "Satoshi's Double Vision"

[19-Apr-19 10:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we did this

[19-Apr-19 10:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
the entire set of BEAM miners become potential BTCH miners, which is interesting

[19-Apr-19 10:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
i haven't heard of any publicly available bitstream for 150,5

[19-Apr-19 10:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
but obviously FPGA dev companies write bitstreams and run privately without ever telling their customers. They do have some transparency with customers, tho

[19-Apr-19 10:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
HAC tells me which bitstreams they are working, or will write soon, if price increases, things like that

[19-Apr-19 10:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
but they could just be running a BEAM bitstream in the back room for 3 months before ever giving it out to customers. Only makes sense to give it to customers if they can't make more money using it privately

[19-Apr-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
what I think is happening is this: ASIC companies have promised 150,5 asics

[19-Apr-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
this makes FPGA companies not consider it

[19-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
but some enterprising FPGA miners are probably running privately-funded BEAM bitstreams, which will never make it into the hand of a "customer"

[19-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
until those ASICs make them run away

[19-Apr-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
they have to test to make sure it works

[19-Apr-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
for 3 months straight, reliability and all that

[19-Apr-19 10:40 AM] dukeleto#7326

does anybody know the ballpark range mergemining increases your BTC mining ROI?

[19-Apr-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
is it like a 1% boost to ROI or 0.01%

[19-Apr-19 05:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
depends on the value of the CoinX you pick, but @! |游괧릔游쮫릔쮫릔.游쓇릔쌒 ! - crackers would likely have the best set of numbers to give an answer

[19-Apr-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
couldnt you merge mine N different coins at once?

[19-Apr-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and even a hashrate that is nothing compared to BTC hashrate, maybe it can find a lot of blocks in a smaller coin

[19-Apr-19 05:09 PM] phm87#7395
Ondalf tested merged mining he can help on this. I will ask him

[19-Apr-19 05:10 PM] phm87#7395
Personnally I tested merged mining with shitcoins and 2 gpus

[19-Apr-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
just need some realistic range

[19-Apr-19 05:10 PM] phm87#7395
Ok I will ask

[19-Apr-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if you make $100 mining BTC with that hashrate will you make $1 in the merge mined coins or $0.01

[19-Apr-19 05:11 PM] phm87#7395
I heard between 2 and 3% but I will check

[19-Apr-19 05:11 PM] phm87#7395
With few coins it can be higher

[19-Apr-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if it werent for the fact you might find 100x the blocks in the smaller coin, it seems like a rounding error, but 2% would be a good boost

[19-Apr-19 05:13 PM] phm87#7395
I will ask @Ondalf  about merged mining profits

[19-Apr-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks. for SHA256

[19-Apr-19 05:19 PM] phm87#7395
I tested for blakecoin algo. It can work on all algos I think. I will search infos for sha256

are there any merged mining profitability stats? i see a chart with revenue if mined directly. i wonder if merge mining approaches the same returns

[19-Apr-19 06:41 PM] Ondalf#1318
if i recall right, doge cannot be mined directly. it simply misses the getblock and getblocktemplate

[19-Apr-19 06:41 PM] Ondalf#1318
only getauxblock and submitauxblock stayed

[19-Apr-19 06:42 PM] Ondalf#1318
but if you look the profitability of pool, that has auxes listed in SHA256, the coins difficulty doesn't change, as aux is not separate chain, but the auxcoins main chain.

[19-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Ondalf#1318
most auxes still allows mining it straight, but since most are also listed at biggest pools to get small extra profit over normal coins, the auxes diff usually is high. seriously high

[19-Apr-19 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the boost to ROI is fraction of a percent?

[19-Apr-19 06:43 PM] Ondalf#1318
yes.

[19-Apr-19 06:45 PM] Ondalf#1318
then there is this oddball called Globaltoken, which has ability to use it as auxpow for equi200,,9 and 144,5. best part, it needs own flags and version number to be able to work with them... haven't yet got it to work. shouldn't be hard though. this GLT also has ability to mine as an aux, when main coin is POS one (PoW+PoS one)
