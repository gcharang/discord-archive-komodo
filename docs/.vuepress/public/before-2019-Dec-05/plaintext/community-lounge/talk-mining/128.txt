here - i am not sure if you miners do taxes, but i do .. and tax season is a bitch...

I have a solution, YOU HEARD  THIS IDEA HERE FIRST FROM ME

`miningfool.com`

 i am working on a great new feature.

soon you will be able to download an excel or spreadsheet file that has a history of all your payouts ... (PURPOSELY BUILT TO MAKE TAXES EASY)

For a year you choose..... i support 7 years of data in the past...

you will be able to download a spreadsheet with your payout history for that entire year by month by day.. payouts will be rolled up for each day.. just the way the tax man likes them...

for each day of there year where you had atleast one payout,  you will have the Coin Name, Coin Amount, US Dollar Amount, DATE
in a nice PERFECT spreadsheet FOR TAX PURPOSES

obviously the link to download will be on your miner page... so its a a spreadsheet report PER address..

but this will make doing taxes SUPER EASY

soon this feature will be available...

YOU HEARD THIS IDEA HERE FIRST

游냆pool's hook is that it's the anti that (aka: I don't store your data any more than nessesary for pool function, because `fek the tax man`)

@g00dnatur3 if you add HUSH to your pool with sapling zaddr payouts, there is a 250 HUSH bounty for that, fyi

If any pools/miners are having issues with daemon locking up please test this fix.

[14-Jun-19 09:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

Does anyone have a public API that tracks blocks that contain unclaimed rewards? I've got personal tools that I use, but I was wondering if there was anything for the general public to see...

[16-Jun-19 10:49 AM] CHMEX#0686
I store each block and it's reward what are you exactly after I'm sure if I have the data I can publish it

[16-Jun-19 10:52 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
was just curious if there was a way for "Joe Average" to see how many bonus blocks there were, when they were, and what the amounts were

sort of a double measure to see if their pool hit a big block and they did/didn't get paid for it (since most pools don't publish more than 100 back)

@Pool-Operator Please update your pool daemon with latest Komodo source ASAP. You can use https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo or https://github.com/jl777/komodo . For branch, we suggest to use `master` branch for pools. However, if you know what you are doing, you can also use `beta` branch. As soon as you finish updating, please ping us here with your pool name. If you need help please ask here. @ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉 @webworker01 @NutellaLicka @mrlynch are experienced pool operator and are ready to help you.

Update process is simple. You can issue the following commands to compile updated `komodod` (change branch name if needed). These commands to be used as general guidance and to keep compile issues at minimum level. If you want to update using your own method, please go ahead.
```
cd ~/komodo
git reset --hard
make clean
git checkout master
git pull
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
Once you finish updating, `getinfo` call should display `"KMDversion: 0.4.0a",`

Note: This is a hardforking update to include next Season 3 Notary Node keys and must be carried out before 15th July. Thank you very much for your co-operation.

but we ar stuck on a agama wallet i hope shombuddy have a tip on how to add zaddex on a pool

[16-Jun-19 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
what does a qt wallet have to do with 'yiimp base pool'?

[16-Jun-19 07:53 PM] zaza68#4573
the proces is the same on a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:53 PM] zaza68#4573
but on the agama wallet the erros how to fix or how it works is difrent

[16-Jun-19 07:54 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
a qt wallet is just a daemon and a gui combined, if you can convert that then you can just convert the daemon

[16-Jun-19 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
chain-wise, there's nothing "special" that's in a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:56 PM] zaza68#4573
othing special on a qt wallet

qt wallet you have guid how to fix promblems a lot of info on the web every think you can fix it

[16-Jun-19 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
I'm saying that there's nothing in a qt wallet that would convert to a pool that isn't in the non-gui daemon

[16-Jun-19 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you asking about pool code and then saying you'd need a gui to do it doesn't make sense

[16-Jun-19 07:58 PM] zaza68#4573
no i did not say i want a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] zaza68#4573
i say i would be easy if zaddex had a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`if zaddex had a qt wallet this was not a problem`
what does that have to do with pool code?

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`i say i would be easy if zaddex had a qt wallet`
no easier than a non-gui daemon

[16-Jun-19 07:59 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
it's the same code

[16-Jun-19 08:00 PM] zaza68#4573
its not about the code its about the wallet setting up

[16-Jun-19 08:00 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
you set up the wallet the same as komodo or any other equihash coin

Hello, has anyone tried mining KMD token on a raspberry pi?

[17-Jun-19 03:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd is ASIC minable, so doubt you will get many blocks on a raspberry pi?

[17-Jun-19 03:57 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
Yes

[17-Jun-19 03:58 PM] StEvUgnIn#7116
But it is just for self-education that I'm interested to try

[17-Jun-19 03:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha, not sure komodod is runable on a raspberry, I think @radix42 made some ports, but not sure if it applies to mining as well

[17-Jun-19 04:00 PM] radix42#3743
you can only theoretically run it on a rasp pi 3B+ if you load a 64bit OS and add a lot of swap
