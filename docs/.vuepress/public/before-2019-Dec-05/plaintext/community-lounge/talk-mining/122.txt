@Ondalf   all these coins may risk or experience 51% or consensus pbs then (I hope) they may migrate to the kmd standards (kmd ac params are developed by experts, tested heavily with bounties). If coinbase entries are standard (according to ac params), we should take this future into account

[01-May-19 08:34 PM] Ondalf#1318
what's there to take in account? from pool perspective, nothing changes? its just wallets and chains that tries to keep up with the hashpower attacks and such things

[01-May-19 08:37 PM] phm87#7395
Few changes should be required. It is good as there is a standard (or future standard). As recently for some coins (emc2 and I don t remember the others)

[01-May-19 08:53 PM] phm87#7395
@Ondalf  do you prefer standard that are very well developed and tested or do you prefer custom code that break once a week ? (Some guys begins again their blockchain once week due to bugs. It won t happen with kmd AC)

thats a funny miner... never send anything so also never claimed

I can't imagine catching that many blocks and never consolidating

[02-May-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, none of those 3KMD utxos earn interest

[02-May-19 11:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
that solo miner has 2300 KMD in utxos not gaining interest, somebody missed a memo

[02-May-19 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_consolidates daily just to get that extra little bit per year_

[02-May-19 11:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
He's catching a nice amount of blocks too actually

I'm just setting up komodo on my mining pool server and I noticed a lot of talk surrounding p2p and magic numbers earlier in this thread. Is that still necessary to set up for the komodo daemon ?

Hi anyone from Blackjok3r pool?pls

Will be ready to announce a new  mining pool next week as I have all the coins I'm going to offer working - just need to integrate nomp into Joomla to finish the website

[03-May-19 08:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You shouldnt mine to an exchange @Deleted User 
For many reasons. You need to contact that exchange if your payments arent arriving. Its not the pools issue

Hello! I've been mining Komodo for a while using suprnova, but i want to change to mine LuckPool, but i have no idea how to mine using my Claymore miner, i have no idea what im doing, i usually follow guides, so if someone could explain to me what i need to do, that would be greatly appreciated !

[07-May-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
So that means all this current ATH hashrate is just from Z11 batch1's being delivered! Maybe some batch2's

[07-May-19 01:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
but the a9++ Dumpening has not yet begun

[07-May-19 01:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC hashrate ATH and ZEC/BTC ATL, seems like we are in a vicious cycle

[07-May-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow PIRATE is avoiding this effect

[07-May-19 01:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because of community I believe,  pirate is one of the largest active privacy coins under monero .  When people believe in a project they will hold

[07-May-19 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Does ZEC have a lot of adoption?

[07-May-19 01:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
I also think that a much larger % of ARRR miners are mining for a longer time horizon, while 90+% of ZEC miners sell at the end of the day/week

[07-May-19 01:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Besides fund miners

[07-May-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon zec has mostly empty blocks, i would say no

[07-May-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
i saw somebody mention 7 xtns/block on average

[07-May-19 01:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
that was for some recent timeframe

[07-May-19 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Adoption and community drive price/marketcap

[07-May-19 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ARRR still has relatively low amounts of both

[07-May-19 01:23 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Imagine if it only increases to 10% the following XMR/ZEC has

[07-May-19 01:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC had a huge, still has, a massive GPU miner community. They mostly feel left out of the ASIC world, many went to mine other GPU coins

[07-May-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
ARRR seems about 30% of ZEC tx activity

[07-May-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
also remember, ZEC forces every utxo to be shielded

[07-May-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
coinbase

[07-May-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
doesn't that double what their tx activity should really look like?

[07-May-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
which is by and large immediately sent to exchange

[07-May-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
right, i am saying that ZEC tx activity will look bigger, because of the shielding rule

[07-May-19 01:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
"organic" ZEC xtns are actually fewer

[07-May-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is likely PIRATE already has the largest zaddr tx pool

[07-May-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
making it a much better "mixer" even without accounting for the massive privacy leakage zcash has from optional privacy

[08-May-19 01:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If you have an asic , goto miningpoolstats.stream and choose a pool,  there is several.   Follow the instructions on the pool site

[08-May-19 04:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Vicente Briones - you will need to determine if you are mining best with your GPU.  Are you familiar with crypto?  Do you have a wallet that can hold Komodo?

[08-May-19 08:27 PM] Vicente Briones#1591
i have a wallet

[08-May-19 08:27 PM] Vicente Briones#1591
but my gpu is a gt1030

[08-May-19 09:49 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Youll find a hard time getting blocks on KMD, but I highly suggest you at least try mining something to see how it all works and the shares incoming and more.

Anyone here have any good NVIDIA mining plays?

Hi. Anyone wanna walk a noob through something? I'm bored and feel like mining something in the komodo ecosystem using nicehash. Not for profit. For fun.  So far I've set up my nicehash wallet.
