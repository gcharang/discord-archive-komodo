watch a tennis match and watch the odds swing more frequently.

[30-Jan-19 02:28 AM] Mylo#8306
it's more volatile than crypto market.

[30-Jan-19 02:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
perfect!

[30-Jan-19 02:28 AM] Mylo#8306
oh you're in NZ.   betfair has clickable buttons.

[30-Jan-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was first time I actually watched some sport from start to finish. 😄

[30-Jan-19 02:29 AM] Mylo#8306
haha...cos of betting?

[30-Jan-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz I had to sit in a stadium, and was first time stadium experience.

[30-Jan-19 02:29 AM] Mylo#8306
oh

[30-Jan-19 02:29 AM] Mylo#8306
well, watch betfair odds with cricket or tennis.  especially tennis

[30-Jan-19 02:30 AM] Mylo#8306
and watch the match.

[30-Jan-19 02:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no betting, I haven't gambled.

[30-Jan-19 02:30 AM] Mylo#8306
just watch the numbers.  you'll like the numbers moving 😃

[30-Jan-19 02:30 AM] Mylo#8306
and the tennis match

[30-Jan-19 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't feel interest in sports much, I only feel happy when I see my friends cheering and feel excited and happy. That gives me more enjoying experience than anyone winning or loosing, since I don't understand almost any outdoor sports rules.

[30-Jan-19 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I favor no sport team, and neither a nation.... 😄

[30-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Mylo#8306
oh yeah for sure.  they say...you go to the cricket to drink beer.  not to watch the cricket 😃

[30-Jan-19 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh nice 😄

[30-Jan-19 02:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I should have had beer then 😄

[30-Jan-19 02:33 AM] Mylo#8306
hope there's a 4th match then 🥁

[30-Jan-19 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, but me and my wife decided to just watch it from home....

[30-Jan-19 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is some basketball match my friend bought tickets for 2 of us... it's this friday.. don't know anything about it... but I guess my wife will teach me .... she's all into the sports and stuff... 😄

i think they switched to bech

[30-Jan-19 11:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... okay, what should be the value of kmd then?

[30-Jan-19 11:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

cool! generated privkey and address:

[30-Jan-19 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna try importing it and see if valid

[30-Jan-19 12:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
after practicing with kmdgo code, I'm getting other code work and understanding tiny bit quicker now... 😛

[30-Jan-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Hey guys

[30-Jan-19 12:54 PM] niksmac#0421
Please correct me if i am wrong 

To run an assetchin based on KOMODO, i have followed the official docs, everything seems to work fine. 

Wanted to create wallets to support the coin. 

1. I have to install Electrumx server as suggested by @cipi  
2. Electumx is talking to komodo instance through RPC
3. Open sufficient ports and open a PR to official Agama wallet

Am i right?

[30-Jan-19 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Jan-19 01:07 PM] niksmac#0421
Thanks @SHossain

[30-Jan-19 01:14 PM] niksmac#0421
How can i test this before i submit a PR to agama?

[30-Jan-19 02:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
@niksmac does it work for you?

[30-Jan-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CryptoMedication kmd can notarize pretty much any coin with a 256bit blockhash, in practice, BTC forks (and any forks of forks) are reasonable to protect, but for instance, adding dpow to Monero or ETH, while technically possible, would require a lot more work. Adding dpow to coins that invented their own internals and/or don't share much with Bitcoin don't get to use the already existing header files that KMD provides

@jl777c @blackjok3r  keep waking up to a dead OUR daemon, finally got the backtrace

[30-Jan-19 07:59 PM] Alright#0419
this node was staking using pos64staker

[30-Jan-19 08:01 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker this is interesting ^^

[30-Jan-19 08:01 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe releated to my issue as well with OUR node?

[30-Jan-19 08:02 PM] Alright#0419
what is your issue?

[30-Jan-19 08:02 PM] SHossain#0007
daemon crashed without any debug.log data

[30-Jan-19 08:02 PM] SHossain#0007
happened only once, today at 3:33:31 am

[30-Jan-19 08:03 PM] SHossain#0007
the node was staking OUR as well

[30-Jan-19 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
right above this there was an error about low disk space, but it seems the VPS had ~6gb free

[30-Jan-19 08:11 PM] SHossain#0007
the computer i used has 17GB free disk space

[30-Jan-19 08:12 PM] SHossain#0007
but, i used a different software

[30-Jan-19 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
different software?

[30-Jan-19 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, a different test app

[30-Jan-19 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
what was it doing?

[30-Jan-19 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
managing utxos?

[30-Jan-19 08:14 PM] SHossain#0007
staking normally

[30-Jan-19 08:15 PM] Alright#0419
what was the test app doing

[30-Jan-19 08:17 PM] SHossain#0007
running native node and staking

[30-Jan-19 08:25 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be due to the changes to LOCK()

[30-Jan-19 08:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright is this a segfault triggered when the miner exits?

[30-Jan-19 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
It seemed that way @dukeleto

[30-Jan-19 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
last thing in debug.log was staker finding a block

[30-Jan-19 08:40 PM] dukeleto#7326

i thought i saw something else more recent in zcash too, but can't find it

[30-Jan-19 08:46 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe add that and see if it still crashes

[30-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
ok will do

[30-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
I tried for a while yesterday to force this to happen

[30-Jan-19 08:50 PM] Alright#0419
seems I must be asleep

[30-Jan-19 08:57 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r need you to merge the segid: -2 fix into jl's branches when you have time
