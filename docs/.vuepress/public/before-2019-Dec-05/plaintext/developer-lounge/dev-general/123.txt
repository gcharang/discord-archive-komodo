[11-Feb-19 03:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
Do you have all the indexes set?

[11-Feb-19 03:49 PM] CHMEX#0686
I have seen that when they are not set

[11-Feb-19 03:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
txindex, addressindex, timestampindex, spentindex all to 1

[11-Feb-19 03:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
Set it manualy in your .conf remove blocks and chainstate and resynch

explorer bug easy fix. After you start it all the first time.. use pkill to kill all aemons the n delete everything apart form conf file. and start all daemons again 👍

[11-Feb-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
is there anyway to set `-blocknotify` without restarting the daemon?

[11-Feb-19 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
iirc it's early in the init, so likely not

[11-Feb-19 10:12 PM] Alright#0419
I want to make the pos64staker as simple as possible, so I don't want the user to have to restart the daemon manually. Any suggestions? I know I could do it with subprocess in python for linux, but I'm not sure how to make it OS agnostic

[11-Feb-19 10:13 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
short of py already being in nix, it should already be 'OS agnostic' by being py

[11-Feb-19 10:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
they'd just have to install py

@dukeleto tried compiling `dev` branch of komodo. Just sharing what I did to fix my issues

[12-Feb-19 12:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```

[12-Feb-19 12:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This is the end result after git clone and executing `./zcutil/build-mac.sh `

[12-Feb-19 12:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```# changed `CC = gcc` in src/cc/Makefile

```

[12-Feb-19 12:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was not sure if `CC=gcc-6 ./zcutil/build-mac.sh` will just set `gcc-6` to all, because it's the `libcc` which needs this change, so I just changed the `Makefile` of `cc`, and tried again.

[12-Feb-19 12:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
This was the result after that

[12-Feb-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
more errors 😄

[12-Feb-19 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway I saw the `dev` branch did not hat the makecclib script, so I just executed the command from my earlier tests

[12-Feb-19 12:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```satinders-MacBook-Pro-2:komodo_test satinder$ cd src/

[12-Feb-19 12:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Now that it created the `libcc.so` I just executed the build mac command again

[12-Feb-19 12:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 your komodod build issues solved on mac mate?

[12-Feb-19 01:53 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@grewalsatinder yes, it was the qt that I was building, but the issue was the same since they use the same make setup, and I didn't even think about the fact that they did use the same

[12-Feb-19 01:55 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Out of curiosity, why does your komodod make file have agama bits?

[12-Feb-19 02:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[12-Feb-19 03:55 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Hi all, I am quite new to the blockchain world, and I am reading some articles about KMD, and I glanced into this.

```First, UTXO-based smart contracts can be written in C, C++, or any other compiled programming language that can create a linkable library capable of calling and being called by C/C++ functions. In that sense, Komodo’s UTXO-based smart contracts are language agnostic. This also means Komodo’s smart contracts are Turing complete and can be programmed to do just about anything.```

I just want to make sure that the one referred to above is the Smart Contract language `Crypto Conditions`

[12-Feb-19 03:55 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks

[12-Feb-19 03:58 AM] gcharang#6833
It is not exactly a language. It is a specification: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions/
It can be implemented in any programing language. there are js,python,C,C++ versions of it available

@gcharang thanks for the information, so the information above is like a draft of Crypto Conditions where on the time the info was written, it was C/C++ as language of choice, and now it has JS and Python as additions.

[12-Feb-19 04:02 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
correct?

[12-Feb-19 04:05 AM] gcharang#6833
Yes. It is a specification. We are using its implementation in C

[12-Feb-19 04:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks @gcharang

[12-Feb-19 04:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Another question, is it okay?

[12-Feb-19 04:17 AM] gcharang#6833
Sure. if not me, someone else will answer

[12-Feb-19 04:17 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So VerusCoin is an Asset Chain right?

[12-Feb-19 04:19 AM] gcharang#6833
All Assetchains are runtime forks of komodo. But Verus coin forked our project and added new assetchain options to it to start their chain. Now those options are available for anyother assetchain created through Komodo. In a way, it is a fork. In another way it is an assetchain. But there are many other features that are in development there that are not in Komodo. So it is not a pure assetchain

[12-Feb-19 04:24 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, it makes sense, so VerusCoin by itself is a Komodo fork, but it has Asset chains from Komodo and it also has a different PoW algorithm right?

So, I asked this question because, I was thinking that, when you create an asset chain, and since asset chains inherit Komodo's technology, will that asset chain be also able to create its own asset chain?

[12-Feb-19 04:24 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
just curious

[12-Feb-19 04:27 AM] gcharang#6833
It depends on how they are doing it.
It is entirely possible for a project to fork Komodo, add new features and it will have assetchain creation available.

[12-Feb-19 04:28 AM] gcharang#6833

Thank you very much.

[12-Feb-19 04:33 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
One thing also, I see 2 source repos for Komodo, the `komodo` and `KomodoPlatform`? Is komodo the cryptocurrency and the latter the platform that implements the Smart Contracts and putting the snapshots in the Bitcoin block?

[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I am really confused on the part where Komodo is protected by Bitcoin's Hash power, so how is KMD inheriting that hash power? and how are the snapshots placed in the bitcoin blocks by the notary nodes?

[12-Feb-19 04:34 AM] gcharang#6833
> will that asset chain be also able to create its own asset chain?
This mostly doesn't make sense. There are two distinct things: 1)The coin daemon
2) The blockchain
The daemon has the rules the chain needs to follow but, the same coin daemon can allow different blockchains to exist.
i.e., ex: the BTC daemon controls the BTC blockchain, but using the same daemon, I can create a new chain that will be mined from block 1 but it is not BTC eventhough it has the same rules

[12-Feb-19 04:36 AM] gcharang#6833
komodo repo: Is the Komodo blockchain repo
Komodoplatform repo: has the dPOW (BTC hashrate security) and marketmaker which is a DEX

[12-Feb-19 04:36 AM] gcharang#6833
dPOW part is called iguana. It is a completely different program seperate from the standard daemon and our notaries run it to backup Komodo hashes to BTC

[12-Feb-19 06:47 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Hi all, may I ask what is theory behind having 2 blockchains linked together to increase performance? How does that work on asset chains? I understand the part where asset chains are created but how do we create another one and link the 2 together?

[12-Feb-19 06:57 AM] jorian#4555
i think @blackjok3r might be able to answer that

[12-Feb-19 06:57 AM] jorian#4555
also try #cc-general

[12-Feb-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You need notary nodes that place block hashes onto both chains and also a full KMD node.. #kmdlabs  has had many fungible clusters...

[12-Feb-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is one live right now I think.. although we just broke one of the chains. The other 2 work lol

Thanks @blackjok3r  and @gcharang so I don't know if my question was answered before, but how does SuperNET get Bitcoin's HASH Power? Since this is part of Komodo's star feature.

[12-Feb-19 07:02 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So the Notary nodes run on `iguana` -> `SuperNET`?

[12-Feb-19 07:03 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
The notary nodes themselves will be the one to put the snapshots to Bitcoin Blocks right?

[12-Feb-19 07:03 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904

It's a long article but It should explain it well

[12-Feb-19 07:09 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@CHMEX Thanks, hope I can really digest all of this, was just really curious on how you write backups on Bitcoin blocks, I mean since you are writing on BTC blocks would it mean, it is affecting Bitcoin's block sizes?

[12-Feb-19 07:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
That it does is writing the latest KMD blockhash into a BTC transaction. That Transaction gets mined into a BTC Block by BTC miners ( not notary nodes )
This is a very simple explenation

[12-Feb-19 07:13 AM] CHMEX#0686

it's 1580 (Bytes)  so not that large

> That it does is writing the latest KMD blockhash into a BTC transaction. That Transaction gets mined into a BTC Block by BTC miners ( not notary nodes )

So you are writing it into the BTC Transaction? I thought the transaction's were non-editable?

[12-Feb-19 07:20 AM] gcharang#6833

Ok got it, so yo add it on the bitcoin vout--scriptPubKey--asm/hex part of the transaction? Like in here? https://insight.bitpay.com/api/tx/c1213daba694b3ecbc0ef4ff506b46af4b3fd3843c78614bbd02e4eaea7bd088

[12-Feb-19 07:29 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Or is it just like creating a simple bitcoin transaction and just adding the KMD latest hash on the script part?

[12-Feb-19 07:37 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
