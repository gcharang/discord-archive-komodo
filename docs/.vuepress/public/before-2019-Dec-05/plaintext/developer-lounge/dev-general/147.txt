You can't admit that the space is out of consensus on terms, meanings, and definitions and  then decide to be the sole determiner of what is/isn't a "lie", a "truth", or even "wrong".
You may have opinions on the subject, but you don't get to be the centralized decider of fact

[22-Mar-19 09:08 PM] zack#6467
it could be a long scam

[22-Mar-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you provide good data for a year so you can run away with a days worth of subscriber fees

[22-Mar-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
0.3% loss

[22-Mar-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if the subscriptions are made daily

[22-Mar-19 09:08 PM] zack#6467
its not the subscriber fees that are important

[22-Mar-19 09:08 PM] jl777c#5810
not any disaster

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] zack#6467
you are using this data for something, right?

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC does not use it

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] zack#6467
for example, if we have a trusted feed to tell us the result of political elections, there could be some money at stake

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] jl777c#5810
other things use oracles CC to manage offchain data onchain

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] zack#6467
so if someone lied about the data, they could make the market for the political election break, and steal money from everyone who was gambling on the election

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] dukeleto#7326
people choose the oracles they trust, KMD doesn't force users to trust a given oracle

[22-Mar-19 09:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We are discusing techinical approaches here, could you stop saying "scam" and liars when referring to komodo?

[22-Mar-19 09:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
This discussion is the best way to spend a layover (with 🍻 ). Hopefully y'all are still going at my next layover

[22-Mar-19 09:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Lol

[22-Mar-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC is low level

[22-Mar-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it is meant to be used by other CC to do things

[22-Mar-19 09:11 PM] Alright#0419
we should rename it "blockchain oracles CC"

what is done is outside the scope of oracles CC, oracles CC does the datafee, pay per data point

[22-Mar-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if people go making all sort of technical assumptions from 4 word summaries and dont read the explanation paragraphs, that is really out of our control

[22-Mar-19 09:12 PM] zack#6467
Oracles CC it is not an oracle. You can't use it to bring data about reality onto the blockchain.
It brings some data that some guy decided to say, and it may or may not be a lie.

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] MyName#0491
`Instead you are trusting some person to put some data that may or may not be related to reality onto the blockchain.
There is no cryptoeconomic guarantees that the data on-chain has any relationship to reality.`
An how does that differ from Amoveo?
You've stated that you can manually "hard update" to stop an oracle "about to lie", what "cryptoeconomic guarantees" exist to ensure that what you do "may or may not be related to reality"?

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] zack#6467
it is a trusted feed. you are trusting someone to feed you some info.

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
and that's what an oracle does

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
that is implicit in data publisher

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
You may or not be a lie, but i would have already stopped paying for your data feed by now.

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
bring off-chain data on-chain

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] MyName#0491
`it is a trusted feed. you are trusting someone to feed you some info.`
and Amoveo users are trusting that you will not maliciously "hard update"

[22-Mar-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
also explicitly explained in the paragraph

[22-Mar-19 09:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zack from what I see, Amoveo is a trusted feed as well, given the reality of 51% attacks and you telling exchanges which git repo to use, and various other reasons

[22-Mar-19 09:14 PM] zack#6467
if I can steal $100 000 by breaking an election market, I really don't care that I wont be paid $10 or whatever in fees for my trusted feed.

[22-Mar-19 09:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
also, this 👇 
```we will do an update to prevent that oracle from being able to close on a lying outcome.```
is quite the opposite of trustless

[22-Mar-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
what election market?

[22-Mar-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
we are not making betting markets with oracles CC

[22-Mar-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a data market

[22-Mar-19 09:15 PM] zack#6467
you intend to use the data for something, right?

[22-Mar-19 09:15 PM] jl777c#5810
one use is the gateways CC that has multisig signers for tokenizing crypto

[22-Mar-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the signers are trusted to safekeep the deposited crypto and redeem it when the tokens are redeemed

[22-Mar-19 09:16 PM] MyName#0491
`if I can steal $100 000 by breaking an election market, I really don't care that I wont be paid $10 or whatever in fees for my trusted feed.`
if I can win $100 000 by betting, I really don't care that I have to pay you $10 or whatever to manually "hard update". (adjusted down from earlier to match)

[22-Mar-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
they are also trusted to post merkle data onchain

[22-Mar-19 09:16 PM] zack#6467
The Komodo oracle CC is not meant to be used to support any betting, or determine who gets any money. Do I have that correct?

[22-Mar-19 09:16 PM] Regnar#6164
It's meant to put off-chain data on-chain

[22-Mar-19 09:16 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC itself is low level and is for offchain data -> onchain for a data fee

[22-Mar-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the scope for oracles CC

[22-Mar-19 09:17 PM] zack#6467
@Regnar  well, it does not do that. It only puts data that some guy decided to put on-chain. You have no idea if it is accurate or not.

[22-Mar-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
using the standard definition for oracle

[22-Mar-19 09:17 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
An assetchain project then sets the trust scheme they prefer

[22-Mar-19 09:17 PM] jl777c#5810
for gateways CC, the same nodes signing the multisig are posting data to the oracles CC

[22-Mar-19 09:17 PM] zack#6467
just because some guy wants to put data on-chain doesn't mean it is an accurate reflection of the state of the world.

[22-Mar-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you are willing to trust the MofN signers with your BTC deposit, you surely are ok to trust them to post valid merkle data

[22-Mar-19 09:18 PM] Regnar#6164
```well, it does not do that. It only puts **data** that some guy decided to put **on-chain**. You have no idea if it is accurate or not.```

[22-Mar-19 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you have to specifically subscribe to a specific publisher

[22-Mar-19 09:18 PM] zack#6467
Komodo trusts M of N signers with bitcoin deposits? that doesn't sound trustless

[22-Mar-19 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC uses automated multisig for a federated tokenization of external crypto

[22-Mar-19 09:19 PM] zack#6467
giving people the freedom to choose who to subscribe to does not make it trustless

[22-Mar-19 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
did I claim it was trustless?

[22-Mar-19 09:19 PM] MyName#0491

`Instead you are trusting some person to put some data that may or may not be related to reality onto the blockchain.

[22-Mar-19 09:20 PM] zack#6467
In Amoveo we use synthetic assets to allow people to hold cryptocurrency from other blockchains. That way it can be trustless.

how can amoveo blockchain trustlessly store BTC ?

[22-Mar-19 09:21 PM] zack#6467
@jl777c  a synthetic asset is a kind of financial derivative. there are no actual bitcoin involved.

It is an asset that stays the same value as bitcoin, but is priced in VEO

[22-Mar-19 09:21 PM] zack#6467

which is fine, but the gateways CC has a different purpose, to tokenize BTC onchain

[22-Mar-19 09:23 PM] zack#6467
the language is turing complete, im just telling about stablecoins as an example

[22-Mar-19 09:23 PM] jl777c#5810
and it uses multisig, which makes it clear those signers are trusted with the BTC deposit

[22-Mar-19 09:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so using oracles CC is withing the existing trust level, and there is no extra risk from using oracles CC, even though oracles CC isnt trustless

[22-Mar-19 09:24 PM] zack#6467
putting trustful bitcoin onto a blockchain is a bad strategy, it is better to be trustless.
Some government will go after you if you are centralized and get big enough.
