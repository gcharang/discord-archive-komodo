After i backup my wallet wif and send my KMD to my wallet, what do i have to do to start getting staking reward for the ammount present?

[23-Jun-19 10:36 PM] Tomcat#7863
Agama

[23-Jun-19 10:37 PM] Tomcat#7863
Downloaded the blockchain , coins not stored directly to them

[23-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Tomcat#7863
The other wallet was bugged for me, I got it, installed everything, and it started syncing. Next day when i opened pc to resume syncing, it freezed when opening so i got agama instead which seems to work fine

[23-Jun-19 10:38 PM] Tomcat#7863
Tried reinstalattions, cleaning registry... still errored

[23-Jun-19 10:39 PM] Tomcat#7863
i got agama 0.60 - 13 PBaas now

[23-Jun-19 10:53 PM] Tomcat#7863
right

[23-Jun-19 10:53 PM] Tomcat#7863
Verus agama

@Deleted User sounds like a question for @Alright or @blackjok3r

[24-Jun-19 03:53 AM] ERIC#3057
Is there any mobile wallet can be used for the assets chain and the tokens  on the assets chain ?

Just a reminder to those who have an idea or want to start a project but needs help with business side of things or funding from a vc, #venturecapital is a new channel opened dedicated to the above. Fabien who’s managing ocryptounion and zaddex will be there to help ✌️

[24-Jun-19 04:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ERIC https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chameleon.wallet&hl=en_US from #chainzilla folks can do that, and you can make a custom version of that app for your asset, or get your asset added to that wallet

@Deleted User  staking will keep the chain moving along on its own, but your PoS% will end up at 100% asnd block will be very slow.

@Deleted User that comment in the docs is a bit egregious, it should stabilize sooner

[25-Jun-19 12:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
but it does take time

[25-Jun-19 12:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH was the first AC to use ac_blocktime, it's worked fine for us

[25-Jun-19 12:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
we use ac_blocktime=150

{Reactions}
👌 

[25-Jun-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on the as_staked setting, how much is staking, what the hashrate is

[26-Jun-19 10:40 AM] Biotech#6005
can anyone help me with this problem:
getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-9,"message":"Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!

[26-Jun-19 10:41 AM] Biotech#6005
anyone know what's going wrong here? is it the komodod daemon or the coin's daemon?

[26-Jun-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
get some peers and get in sync

[26-Jun-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
"Cannot get a block template while no peers are connected or chain not in sync!"

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Biotech#6005
how to setup peers? is it in the coins .json file?

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
what coin?

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
addnode for peers on the coin

[26-Jun-19 10:45 AM] Biotech#6005
zexo

[26-Jun-19 10:46 AM] Biotech#6005
starting it with:

[26-Jun-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
how many peers do you have?

[26-Jun-19 10:47 AM] Biotech#6005
i have the 2 from the script above

[26-Jun-19 10:47 AM] Biotech#6005
but only in  that script

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] Biotech#6005
the blockchain is synced, from the getinfo

[26-Jun-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
how many peers?

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] Biotech#6005
ohh, you need to do that aswell?

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to get some actual peers

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
then over time you automatically get more

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
or you can force add them to make the process faster

[26-Jun-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
check on explorer that it is actually in sync and has peers

[26-Jun-19 10:51 AM] Biotech#6005
thnx alot, will try 😃

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] Biotech#6005
are there any way to check what peers that are up and running on your daemon?
still same problem

[26-Jun-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
getpeerinfo

[26-Jun-19 11:26 AM] Biotech#6005
i have 16 peers in the ZEXO daemon. but still im getting that error msg

[26-Jun-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain can you reproduce this?

[26-Jun-19 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
i see this message on pool console quite often. Decker said this is ok to ignore, unless it's flooding the console
```

[26-Jun-19 11:32 AM] Biotech#6005
i also got this:

that should only happen at the very beginning

[26-Jun-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
is it syncing blocks?

[26-Jun-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
can you send and receive coins?

[26-Jun-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, all is well

[26-Jun-19 11:33 AM] Biotech#6005
no, the sync is done.

[26-Jun-19 11:33 AM] SHossain#0007
if that error output is not creating issue and not stalling pool functionality, ok to ignore. 
i'll start a fresh ZEXO sync on my machine and will keep an eye on the debug.log

[26-Jun-19 11:34 AM] Biotech#6005
i also got:
[zexo] (Thread 1) getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-1,"message":"CreateNewBlock(): create block failed"}
so pool have some kind of problem

[26-Jun-19 11:34 AM] SHossain#0007
`[zexo] (Thread 1) getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-1,"message":"CreateNewBlock(): create block failed"}`
this is ok to ignore unless it's flooding your terminal

[26-Jun-19 11:34 AM] SHossain#0007
it happens even for KMD sometimes

[26-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Biotech#6005
gotten a few of this aswell, so no blocks found so far, and ive should have found a few sins yesterday
We thought a block was found but it was rejected by the daemon, share data: {"job":"ccde","ip":"::ffff:MYIP","port":xxxx,"worker":"RM6TMd2P4pRvEnGn3SZ3wK65bJVS5Juw7E.a2","height":64889,"difficulty":17.20810835,"shareDiff":"45.20749748","blockDiff":12.294314937,"blockDiffActual":12.294314937,"blockHash":"00002d4d5e4b8da9a605c236bc61245e96cdead237e030e30edb543c7fed839d","error":{"unknown":"check coin daemon logs"}}

[26-Jun-19 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
this could be some other node found and submitted same block before you. so, your one is rejected

[26-Jun-19 11:36 AM] Biotech#6005
every block i found was like that

[26-Jun-19 11:37 AM] SHossain#0007
is your pool finding block at all?

[26-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Biotech#6005
no, all blocks i find, or thing i found, gives me that error

[26-Jun-19 11:37 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
what pool code are you using?

[26-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Biotech#6005
s-nomp

[26-Jun-19 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's why

[26-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Biotech#6005
oh?

[26-Jun-19 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
use k-nomp or z-nomp i would say

[26-Jun-19 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
snomp is not made for Komodo-based chains and is only coincidence when it works for KMD even

[26-Jun-19 11:39 AM] Biotech#6005
wierd, as s-nomp was made for the equihash coins?

[26-Jun-19 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
of any "premade" nomp forks, I'd suggest knomp

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[26-Jun-19 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
knomp is the best so far

[26-Jun-19 11:40 AM] Biotech#6005
I will give knomp a try then. Hopefully better luck there :)
thnx alot for your help and knownledge so far 😃

[26-Jun-19 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

ZEXO may need special pool code.

[26-Jun-19 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
was just about to add that

[26-Jun-19 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I think it needs disablecb

[26-Jun-19 11:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think because of ac_perc it would need either disablecb or some special coinbase  code

[26-Jun-19 11:43 AM] SHossain#0007
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 and @That_Guy8 are running ZEXO pools currently

[26-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Biotech#6005
i have the disablecb aswell

[26-Jun-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mine goes a whole different route 😛

[26-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Biotech#6005
talked abit with that_guy but dont want to bother him so much ^^

[26-Jun-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I spent months of testing to avoid the 3 seconds it takes to use disablecb

{Reactions}
😂 

[26-Jun-19 02:19 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Yeah knomp is the one to use

[26-Jun-19 03:19 PM] miraculu#8334
I have a few of questions that are so important to me as I get familiar with how komodo work: 
1) How scalable are asset chains in terms of transactions per seconds. 
2) Is it advisable to use a 100% staking asset chain for a high amount of transactions per sec. 
3) How do I build a smart contract and/or webapp on top my asset chain.

[26-Jun-19 03:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) you can build out fungible chains at will with proper settings and infrastructure 
2) no
3) I leave to folks in that area

[26-Jun-19 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100% staking asset chain requires that a specific number of UTXOs are always available (and actively being staked) and unless you control 100% of the supply you cannot guarantee that the chain will move 100% of the time
also, staking takes 1 tx out of the process-able txes so 100% of the time you would be lessening the actual txp/s by 1 per block

[26-Jun-19 03:52 PM] radix42#3743
I can't get a build of the latest komodo master on Mac with any gcc version including gcc8 that it wants to build with on Mojave, anyone having luck? I mostly just need current binaries of 0.4.0a to ship with the SevenSeas Pirate wallet for mac and I don't care if someone else on the team built them, halp

[26-Jun-19 03:53 PM] radix42#3743
anyone know what macOS release we've been testing builds on?
