for example you need to edit rpcport on this line to the value of yourchain rpcport,  
<https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo-explorers-install/blob/master/install-explorer.sh#L76> 
I don't know if that's everything you need to edit in order to make it work though

[25-Nov-19 04:22 PM] pandaanu73#7907
for first 2times i haven't need to change any thing but now it is giving erros, first try this if it change.

[25-Nov-19 04:32 PM] pandaanu73#7907
if i do this after install do it work?

[25-Nov-19 04:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
how do I know lol

[25-Nov-19 04:44 PM] pandaanu73#7907
ok

I'm checking on Automake tools and trying to compile `libnspv` as library file instead of binary `nspv`.
I see the `Makefile.am` has this to compile nspv.c and it's .h header files including the defined header and .a library files to compile it as a binary.

[28-Nov-19 01:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
still fairly fresh to understand automake tools, so I tried adding this to make library, which is a copy of the program, but with additional change

[28-Nov-19 01:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
nspv program compile part in Makefile.am

[28-Nov-19 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```
inst_PROGRAMS += nspv
nspv_LDADD = libbtc.la $(LIBCRYPTOCONDITIONS) -lpthread -lsodium
nspv_SOURCES = \
src/tools/nspv.c 
nspv_CFLAGS = $(libbtc_la_CFLAGS) -O2  -Wno-unused-parameter
nspv_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/src
nspv_LDFLAGS = -static
```

[28-Nov-19 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I added this to make a library

[28-Nov-19 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```lib_LTLIBRARIES = libnspv.la
noinst_LTLIBRARIES=libnspv.la
include_HEADERS = \
    libnspv_LDADD = libbtc.la $(LIBCRYPTOCONDITIONS) -lpthread -lsodium
    libnspv_SOURCES = \
    src/tools/nspv.c
    libnspv_CFLAGS = $(libbtc_la_CFLAGS) -O2  -Wno-unused-parameter
    libnspv_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/src
    # libnspv_LDFLAGS = -static
```

[28-Nov-19 01:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
doing `autogen.sh` in root directory gives warning as following:

[28-Nov-19 01:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I guess I can not have multiple lib_LTLIBRARIES defined in Makefile.am 🤔

[28-Nov-19 01:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I also tried manual way to compile nspv as library or even just to compile as binary and that try also failed for me

[28-Nov-19 01:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this command with `-static` flag:

[28-Nov-19 01:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
quick search on google says that means I can not have the system library included to compile it as static....

[28-Nov-19 01:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but the Maketools are compiling it to static 🤔

[28-Nov-19 01:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I removed the `-static` and tried without that, and got this output:

[28-Nov-19 01:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
all I want is to compile nspv.c as a library. as is. I know it might now make sense to some devs why I'm doing it, but I will later make chances to this .c file and would like to compile it as a library.

[28-Nov-19 01:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now I was just trying to check if I can compile it as library or not, but that check/try failed.

[28-Nov-19 01:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
would really appreciate if someone can help me unstuck from this part 🙂

so I made a copy of `nspv.c` to `libnspv.c`

[28-Nov-19 12:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
renamed `main()` to `startnspv()` in `libnspv.c`

[28-Nov-19 12:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
compiled `libnspv.c` as a library file `libnspv.a`

[28-Nov-19 12:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can made a header file for this `nspv.h` with `startnspv()` function definition.

[28-Nov-19 12:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
used the `libnspv.a` in my own `.c` file and called `startnspv()` with arguments defined in that `.c` file

[28-Nov-19 12:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it didn't work straight forwarded, and gave bunch of errors. learned what I was doing wrong and some times just did hit and try thing.

it's a test done on mac os, so the libs and binary there are for mac.

[28-Nov-19 12:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess I should make a make tools files to do another practice and have it ready to be usable for cross platform

[28-Nov-19 12:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and since the test code folder I have in my c-practice has all the header files, calling them will allow to use the libbc, libsecp, libcryptoconditions, libnspv methods etc in own file

[28-Nov-19 12:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

the reason I wanted to have a `libnspv.a` library was to embed it with the iOS or Android app

[28-Nov-19 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
as little as I know, these apps prefer to have the library files included in them

[28-Nov-19 12:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and call the functions, methods from that library and use them

[28-Nov-19 12:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so my hope is when I get to the point making a mobile app, I could be able to use this `.a` library file in it and start nspv through that app and we can have a mobile app nSPV client

Noticed a broken link in the Tutorial docs.
Bottoms of this page <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-1.html#create-a-blockchain> there's `Link to the next tutorial in this series` going to <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/overview-of-development-on-komodo-part-2.html> which is a `404` error

I read about submarine swaps between onchain coins and offchain Lightning Network coins. They made it work on BTC, LTC and ETH. I don't know if a submarine swap (onchain altcoins paid to pay a LN invoice) can work on KMD/ZEC. I didn't read on inverse submarive swaps.

Websites such as <https://swapready.net/> doesn't show submarine swap readyness and as a submarine swap requires HTLC on KMD, maybe it is possible (no malleability fix needed)

[01-Dec-19 01:40 AM] phm87#7395
Maybe it was never tested but I think that KMD supports HTLC and timelocks so it should be possible to do a submarine swap KMD/LN BTC ... and a later stage decentralize <https://submarineswaps.org/> for all cryptos on mm2

Reverse submarine swap is another subject

@dimxy giving a try to compile libnspv on mac using ndk toolchain

[01-Dec-19 09:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and getting libevent headers missing

[01-Dec-19 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see we can compile it, but I jus have to figure out complete it's requirements having the libevent and rest of the required libs available via android tools too

[01-Dec-19 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
followed this standalone toolchain guide:

this so far worked without issue, just at step to find headers for libevent.

[01-Dec-19 09:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will keep posted with whatever is my status with it.

hi @grewalsatinder 
libevent is not a ndk part.
I think it should be installed additionally (libevent-dev)

[01-Dec-19 09:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep,
