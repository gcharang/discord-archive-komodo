getinfo stuff isnt validating the notarizations though right? just assumign the getinfo call has the right data?

[27-Jul-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
getinfo just returns the raw data

[27-Jul-19 05:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes so  how do wer know that the notarization we are trusting to tell us the chain is real?

[27-Jul-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
for each notarization, you would want to do the notarization validation code

[27-Jul-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
that likely needs to be a new api call

[27-Jul-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
gettransaction does prevntz and nextntz

[27-Jul-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yea, in this case it can only do prev so that code doesnt work as is

[27-Jul-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be setup so you can validate just a single notarization

[27-Jul-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
make a more surgical function that just validates a single notarization

[27-Jul-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
understood

[27-Jul-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
then the gettransaction can call it twice

[27-Jul-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the headers tracking just calls it once when it sees a new notarization

[27-Jul-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so the new api for validating a notarization, is just using the similar code to what is in gettransaction, then changing gettransaction to use that twice. that will not increase code

[27-Jul-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
now there will be a function that validates a notarization in isolation

[27-Jul-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
hdrheight is updated to get +1, +2, +3, ...

[27-Jul-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
getinfo processing just updates the non-notarized blockhashes array

[27-Jul-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
anything wonky, and reset to last notarization. that will deal with reorgs, but end in a meta (un)stable state when there is a competing fork, but in such cases best to not do tx anyway

[27-Jul-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
at some point a new notarization comes in and it all starts over

[27-Jul-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is really a matter to process the chaintip for 10 to 20 blocks

[27-Jul-19 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it could be more than that at times, anyway I understand what to do now.

[27-Jul-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r i think if getinfo returned the number of times the non-notarized blockhashes array has been reset, it will give an indication if there is an active fork/attacker

[27-Jul-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant just make up an invalid blockheader, so that eliminates trusting the fullnode

[27-Jul-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there is an edgecase of notary mined blocks, which if needed we can validate did not mine more than once in the last 65 blocks

[27-Jul-19 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, dont go too crazy with lots of code for this. we just need something simple to track the non-notarized chain. anybody doing large amounts should wait for everything to be notarized anyway, so it is more a detector for current chain conditions

[27-Jul-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I've got most of it working already, but the main limitation is that it currently requests the blocks in order, and as such pulls all of them from all nodes.
I had it so that it just pulled them all, but then they arrive out of order, and its much harder to sort them out.

[27-Jul-19 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also doing them all at once, some nodes return bad data or nothing and u end up with gaps.

[27-Jul-19 09:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The main problem I see is on start up if there is no notarizations for like the last 20-30 blocks it takes quite a while to fill the array.

[27-Jul-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
just let it trickle in

[27-Jul-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
one request per height

[27-Jul-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
in a few minutes you will have all. i guess you need to cache the entire header, not just the hash, so you can hande things out of order

[27-Jul-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as each getinfo hdrheight is for a height you dont have, then you are getting numpeers*2 headers per minute

[27-Jul-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
for getting a backlinked non-notarized chain a few minutes is fine. unless your utxo are notarized, it isnt notarized anyway, regardless of the state of the non-notarized chain

[27-Jul-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so only if you are doing non-notarized tx, then you would need the non-notarized blocks

[27-Jul-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV is designed to scale to millions of users. having nodes blasting away to get optional data in a few seconds is not worth increasing the maxload

[27-Jul-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand this part "as such pulls all of them from all nodes"

[27-Jul-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to get duplicates as long as the headers end up linking back to the notarization. so in NSPV_periodic, increment to the next height for each request, that will get a different one from each peer

[27-Jul-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
once you get to the chaintip-1, set a flag that you made all the requests

[27-Jul-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if this flag is set, then on each NSPV_periodic, scan from the notarization to the first header that doesnt exist

[27-Jul-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
separately, have a function that validates the backlinks, maybe when displaying the local getinfo result, you can just display the status of the headers array

[27-Jul-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
before doing a non-notarized spend, then also use this to determine if we have all headers and it is reasonably safe

[27-Jul-19 11:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The problem is that it calls the same height from every node at the same time,  if you place the counter in the function that does the calls it will request them all , and then they arrive out of order, with headers missing.

[27-Jul-19 11:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We can fetch them like this, but then we need to sort them and try and request missing ones, gets complicated.

[27-Jul-19 11:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My understanding from your description was to just fetch them one at a time and store them in order, but is very slow and only uses the first response it gets, as all peers send the same thing

[27-Jul-19 02:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I have it pretty close now.

[27-Jul-19 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
they will return the value of hdrheight

[27-Jul-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
just change the value you request for each peer, ie. have some shared global variable that increments each time a hdrheight is requested

[27-Jul-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
then each peer will return a different height

[27-Jul-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to get it after the first batch

[27-Jul-19 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
just on request, increment. dont wait for it to arrive

[27-Jul-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
handle out of order by just copying the entire header to a headers[] array

[27-Jul-19 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
separate out functions that validate the headers array

[27-Jul-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
allocate the buffer where [0] is the most recent notarization, [1] is the next height, etc.

[27-Jul-19 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
dont worry about processing it on the fly, but if you do get a conflicting one, then maybe ignore it for now. most peers will send the correct value

[27-Jul-19 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I already have it working

shoul;d also handle reorgs just fine I think

[27-Jul-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
almost impossible to validate the notarization without any data so I just made it count peers that agree before updating

[27-Jul-19 05:01 PM] blackjok3r#3181
seems very fast and appears to work fine so far

[27-Jul-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
cant you validate the notarization with txproof and using how it is done in gettransaction?

[27-Jul-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
being very fast is good

[27-Jul-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I gave to get the tx first lol, that data doestn exist

[27-Jul-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need to test reorg handling

[27-Jul-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think it will work, but im not sure
Basically it just hashes hte blopck header, saves that along with the hashprevblock and height

[27-Jul-19 05:04 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I can optimize it a bit more stil, because on KMD it takes liek 10 blocks for a nota to be seen as valid, so all those blocks are lost and have to be fetched again when one comes in.

[27-Jul-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean by "I gave to get the tx first lol, that data doestn exist" ?

[27-Jul-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
dont you know the notarization txid

[27-Jul-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes but I need to get the tx, which node to I get it from?

[27-Jul-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
all of them?

[27-Jul-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just one is enough

[27-Jul-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
you hash the raw tx data and if it matches the txid and it also has notarization opereturn data, it is a valid notarization

[27-Jul-19 05:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If all nodes agree the notariztion is valid what does it matter?

[27-Jul-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
because by actually validating you can protect against an eclipse attack where all your peers are evil

[27-Jul-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
you can validate a notarization 100% locally once you get the rawtxbytes

[27-Jul-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but you can only fertch the tx from one of those peers 😄

[27-Jul-19 05:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so they can fke it

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if they send an invalid raw hex, then it is rejected

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
what if they make one?

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
make one that is signed by all the notarize

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
did you look at the notarization valiation code?

[27-Jul-19 05:07 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but its deep inside many functions

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
given the rawtx for a notarization, it validates it locally that it is a valid notarization

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I need an easy way to fetch just the tx, but doesnt seem to be one

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
txproof

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
that gets the tx

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
txproof without height, gets only the rawtx

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I looked at that... Guess I look again

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
with the height, it gets the rawtx and the txproof

[27-Jul-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but for notarization, we dont need the txproof

[27-Jul-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
just the rawtx

[27-Jul-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is selfcontained and validatable

[27-Jul-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ahah, I read the output of that RPC wrong.. .I thaught it was all 000 with no height, but it does have a txid

[27-Jul-19 05:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
cool

[27-Jul-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
NSPV_notarizationextract that calls the opretextract and fastnotaries count

[27-Jul-19 05:10 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I found all that easy enough. just needed the tx

[27-Jul-19 05:10 PM] jl777c#5810
you should just be able to setup to call NSPV_notarizationextract given the txproof ntztxid ht 0 returned valie

[27-Jul-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
lets make nspv as streamlined and efficient as possible
