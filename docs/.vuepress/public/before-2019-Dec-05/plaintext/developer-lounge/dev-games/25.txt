Is trademark an issue when using similar names and art?

[24-Mar-19 04:26 AM] PTYX#6840
I was just reading about soldier boy getting sued for infringing nintendo trademark so the thought crossed my mind.

[24-Mar-19 06:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
depends

[24-Mar-19 06:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Trademarks, copyright infringement and legal stuff are definitely an issue.

So, the update of today. If you didn't knew, RedFOX Labs is accelerating projects in South East Asia, but but but, I had an awesome talk with @Bitcoin Benny. More news to come, so cooking up stuff in the kitchen. Meanwhile in the batcave, I have started to working on a long term plan for the gaming SDK's, and together with @FishyGuts thinking about a profile for us to set out. Thanks to @Mylo we got 90 days to bring our best out to apply for grants, and @Meyse keeps feeding me game ideas. Tomorrow, I've a meeting with a potential 2d artist, tuesday getting budgets, marketing and branding alive with cool stuff. Komodore64 has a way more retro look and the skillful fingers and help from our hero @Steve Lee are praised with hands reaching the roof. It's sunday, and we are cooking, planning, moving, hyping and fired up.

Together we are strong.

Today's grand news - just kidding. Offices tuned, gamified and a boilerplate of 270Gb of game assets pure for fun and profit, and wrapping up the last parts of it. Pretty much, we can now build almost *anything*. Hardware set up, and we have a rough plan of things; hopefully our team gets an extra power up, so fingers crossed. I made a small plan for world domination and bought some donuts. Keeping ya'll posted!

With a super engine stripper, all functionality, with exception of all other game content, the default executable for a Komodore64 game is 88.4 megs. I'll probably strip it later, but hooray, the boiler plate has been born!

RPG's are the most intensive games to create. We got funding, and budget, but money burns fast and we have a lot of things to do. If you want to support us, believe in proper investment, holla at me or @FishyGuts. Our fridge is supported already by 5 KMD, and our operational stuff, well, you'll hear more on friday

Have you played any of these IO games @TwilightPunkster K64 ?

[26-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Regnar#6164
there's two in particular I'm very fond of, surviv.io and krunker.io  Those are the URLs the games are at, every time you go to it, it assigns you to a server to play in.

[26-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Regnar#6164
Surviv is a top down battle royale style, and Krunker is like a blocky 1st person shooter

[26-Mar-19 07:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Slither.io was my kids fave when younger because they could get it to work at school 😛

[26-Mar-19 07:16 PM] ronyi#5719
agar.io, superhex.io, hexagor.io

[26-Mar-19 10:08 PM] Regnar#6164
I wonder what type of engine those games are generally built on

[26-Mar-19 11:18 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
my fav is starblast.io

Just wanted to do a placeholder website until Tpunk and the team can get the finality in sight.  Will finish it up today.  Again, just basic and for informational purposes only.. for submitting grant applications and such.   NOT the official site.

So the update of today! A lot of meetings, calls, investors, development, planning... we are working towards a website, and we are creating a profile pictures of the team, writing texts and so on. Meanwhile at after hours, I am working on the SDK's and the game content. Last weeks have been a wild rollercoaster ride.

Yup, to make things properly happen though takes a lot of things. We already had to make some serious investments, and remember we have been just been doing this for some weeks (first week with desks).
