well, simple solutions end up in me documenting stuff xD

[12-Mar-19 04:26 AM] Mylo#8306
We can create this with no fan fare.   New chain, billion coins in a faucet.  Game dev and players can all access faucet for tx to enable save game features.
Any ingame economy can be at token level with little or no relationship to underlying coin.

[12-Mar-19 04:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and I hate documenting

[12-Mar-19 04:27 AM] Mylo#8306
I’ll chat to @siu - Chainmakers from Chain makers and Steve.  The KMDICE game has half its supply locked up for ppl to unlock by “playing”

[12-Mar-19 04:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically a lot of good ideas. But I am gonna call out the elephant in the room.

[12-Mar-19 04:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
"Budget"

[12-Mar-19 04:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Everyone loves good idea's, but nobody loves bills xD

[12-Mar-19 04:28 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok.  At chain level, and simple feature of save game.  No probs.
At game integration level, I hear ya.

[12-Mar-19 04:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Nah its not that horrible, but the thing is, don't half ass two things, whole ass one thing.

gotta love Swanson

[12-Mar-19 04:31 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah, no half measures

[12-Mar-19 05:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
What if we combine all ideas and make them co-existing

[12-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Mylo#8306
i'm all in.

[12-Mar-19 06:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, if we look at all the things are set in motion, yet haven't been born yet, all I see its just a resources issue.

[12-Mar-19 06:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, what if we create a whole chain that is pragmatic, intuitive, for the people by the people that is an end-to-end solution.

[12-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
So for starters, Team Komodo provided me with some resources to make an infinite amount of royalty free games (thanks @Team  Admin). As you probably have noticed, I can make games, and so can others. What needs to be in place are turnkey solutions - plugins and tutorials to onboard people to create content. 

Now, who have noticed, I did manage to create a bare bones Unity plugin with ease, and a little logical layer on top of that. However, before that is properly "usable", that will take at least some days of my dedicated time, probably some weeks to actually create decent tutorials for it. However, this missing link can be a driver, as it is one of the most popular engines for indie game developers.

Eventually games need to be published somewhere so players can find them and purchase them (either through single fee or monthly subscription), which could be bought either through KMD and maybe support other coins that are "powered by Komodo". Not just games, but related can be tools - like Itch.io

All this stuff is easy, but it will cost time, resources like money and hardware. I am willing to pitch in where I can but remember I am (partially) human, so I can do only so much.

For example, my brother from another mother @TonyL uses Linux. At this point, I have to wait a whole hour to switch platforms. That kinda sucks, There are plenty of Linux users out there, who'd love games. So I'd definitely would vouch for a "build" pipeline that makes life easier. But that would take at least 2 grand at bare minimum, and trust me, you don't want bare minimum.

👌 ❤ 

[12-Mar-19 06:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, take something simple like beta testing (thank you @FishyGuts and @Cryptofist), which is cool, but that stuff should be done with forms and at very least a fucking Trello plus an issue tracker. All these tiny things require often a microservice to be in place.

[12-Mar-19 06:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Yet, everyone loves multiplayer. Which is cool, but basically that stuff is expensive as fuck. Either you get stuck with DIY or vendorlocking cloud services. Either way, to support a huge amount of players, bet on burning 5K at least just to fire shit up. Remember demos and funky dunky apps are not production apps. It takes next level shit.

[12-Mar-19 06:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, you don't want just games, you want people to adopt the technology; this means streaming, creating added-value content. You can't do a good video with crap sound or a bad camera; this might work for a random video, but sadly us humans aren't cats (no near that cute factor purrrr).

[12-Mar-19 06:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(also if someone disagrees about the networking stuff, imagine the things that aren't blockchain related - builds, chat service, etc.)

[12-Mar-19 06:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably you are gonna need some dedicated people who can manage community and distribute information; creating visibility and moment. Evangelist are great, but great battles are won when people connect with each other; together we are strong. But beer and pizza are sadly not free either.

[12-Mar-19 06:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[12-Mar-19 06:33 AM] Mylo#8306
networking.  noted.   i wrote low level comms stuff 15 years ago and our dPoW service and marketmaker v2 uses bittorrent DHT to punch holes thru NAT.
i miss the old LAN style games, but now requiring a connction to the net to play locally is bollocks.

what is this "linux build pipeline" that takes 1 hour to switch, you mean reboot and get in the flow?   or does it take a while to build the game and the content into a package?   what kind of specs?

[12-Mar-19 06:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
No, when you create a game in a game engine, you need to "port" for a target build. Also rebooting is often not an option, as the perfect solution is to build in parallel.

[12-Mar-19 06:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Unity has Cloud Build but it does come with some "caveats"

[12-Mar-19 06:36 AM] Mylo#8306
"port" = corss compile?

[12-Mar-19 06:36 AM] Mylo#8306
*cross

[12-Mar-19 06:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, you want for a games outlet that game developers can provide games, but also update them. This would be easy like with a bdiff tool.

[12-Mar-19 06:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Yup.

[12-Mar-19 06:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

I am about to get my meds, so I am going to stretch a little, since I'll be horizontal for a hour. Let's hope I can type after - its like a dice roll sometimes.

[12-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Oh, tiny note, I am going to talk about this game at a local event, if some of you are going somewhere like a meetup and want to do a lightning talk and demo this game (almost done), DM me. Make sure its a registered meetup, as @Cryptofist and @FishyGuts somehow enjoy writing stuff, so that might be a good thing to cover that exposure.

[12-Mar-19 11:11 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(Just one demand - don't superhero me, I am just a person that happened to be at the right time, the right place with the right amount of time. So if someone asks who did it, say @TonyL - which is true facts, because he helped me make it happen)

@TwilightPunkster K64 at your request I ripped all the stuff about you outof it, which when originally written it was a bit longer. So I then waitied and added more and it works quite well I think.  I'd still like to share your intial experience about finding and deciding on KMD.

Now having said that, Team Komodo has provided us with resources to produce content, along with supportive community members like @FishyGuts to make gaming a first class citizen. We don't only believe this is good for the community, but to bring the world to the inevitable future of cryptocurrency.
