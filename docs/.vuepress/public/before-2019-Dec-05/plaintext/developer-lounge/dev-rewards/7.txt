Once we saw it was possible, we moved fast to implement it. Nowhere in the private or public channels did I see this was something we had to keep privagte

[10-Dec-18 09:40 PM] PTYX#6840
Nor did I see anything pointing to Hyperdex team getting funds or something for this that wasn't negotiated already

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We have not even released our product because we were still testing.

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] PTYX#6840
So in my eyes, it was open source.

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Testing to make sure it is safe

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] PTYX#6840
I am not a mindreader pondsea.

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You have contributed 0 funds to get this working.

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] PTYX#6840
why didn't you specify that? or maybe dropped us a line in the community chat to tell us that

[10-Dec-18 09:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`We have not even released our product because we were still testing.`
Then how are you saying it was "stolen"?
I'm cornfuzzed

[10-Dec-18 09:42 PM] PTYX#6840
you create something for the community, and get angry when the community builds something with it

[10-Dec-18 09:42 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Specify what? Have the decency to wait till we released it?

[10-Dec-18 09:42 PM] PTYX#6840
how was i supposed to know it was not released? wasn't it on github already?

[10-Dec-18 09:42 PM] PTYX#6840
you posted about it

[10-Dec-18 09:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you pushed it to a git, you "released" it; because, words

[10-Dec-18 09:43 PM] PTYX#6840
you are contradicting yourself and i don't feel i have to justify my actions. i give credit where credit is due and if it's open source the code should reflect the author, not the tweet

[10-Dec-18 09:43 PM] PTYX#6840
or social media post which is why you are angry

[10-Dec-18 09:43 PM] PTYX#6840
because we made a video showing the claim function

[10-Dec-18 09:43 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No i am angry because i funded this solution and getting it to work.

[10-Dec-18 09:44 PM] PTYX#6840
i can't "steal" what is open source.

[10-Dec-18 09:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`No i am angry because i funded this solution and getting it to work.`
So, you paid for it, gave it away for free, and then got mad because someone used the free code?
Now you know why it's so feken hard to find people willing to dev anyfekenthing

[10-Dec-18 09:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
🤦🏽

[10-Dec-18 09:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This app was going to help us make hyperDEX better. A revenue source to fund further development.

[10-Dec-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
fwiw, this is all every reason why I refuse to sign NDAs :trollface:

[10-Dec-18 09:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This is open source, true. What you did was low. This means that no one will contribute in the future.

[10-Dec-18 09:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This app was going to help us make hyperDEX better. A revenue source to fund further development.`
Then you shouldn't have made the code open-source if you wanted exclusive usage

[10-Dec-18 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Someone will trust a closed source app to send funds?

[10-Dec-18 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Sure

[10-Dec-18 09:48 PM] PTYX#6840
i think you are mistaken. i hold no animosity against you even after you calling me a thief. I think there was some miscommunication and possibly bad management on your part for releasing it without any warning or internal notification to the ecosystem

[10-Dec-18 09:48 PM] PTYX#6840
As for people working with us, time will tell.

[10-Dec-18 09:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
No mistakes made.

[10-Dec-18 09:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You have killed off further development for the Komodo community due to your own selfish interests

[10-Dec-18 09:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`This is open source, true. What you did was low. This means that no one will contribute in the future.`
Who are these douchebags that you pay to write code that care who uses it where after they get paid? And where do I sign up for this magical right to care?

[10-Dec-18 09:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Deleted User I wasn't being sarcastic
If you get paid to knowingly write code for an open-source project and then you refuse to work on the project because someone else used that open-source code, then you're a douchebag

[10-Dec-18 09:50 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm still open for collaboration with you Pondsea. I've always had high respect for you as a longstanding Komodo member. When you cool down i'm open to talk.

[10-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Alright#0419
`i can't "steal" what is open source.` you can if you don't follow the license

[10-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
Pondsea, is your wallet begware? ie open source and dev donation optional? Not trying to stir up shit with this question, just wondering if that's how you're going about it

[10-Dec-18 09:53 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Alright for ledger, there was going to be a fee on the claimed interest.

[10-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Alright#0419
open source? or?

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That was to go to fund further app development for Komodo

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Open source

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
Well then you will be the clear cut winner IMO

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
ZILLA's solution is not open source

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Alright#0419
and they are charging devs for integration

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] PTYX#6840
were talking about 2 different wallets @Alright

[10-Dec-18 09:54 PM] PTYX#6840
this is about the magnum wallet

[10-Dec-18 09:55 PM] PTYX#6840
we wont have chameleon desktop ready for some time and by that time we look for a different implementation if it we have to

[10-Dec-18 09:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
How dafuq can this much shit be started over an MIT license? 🤦🏽

[10-Dec-18 09:56 PM] Alright#0419
if you make a wallet that assetchains can use for ledger support that doesn't limit devs from adding their own coin, it'll help out immensely. Likely to attract KMD users by doing that as well so some revenue

[10-Dec-18 09:57 PM] PTYX#6840
@Alright i think the plan is to have ledger implemented into agama so that becomes the whitelalber open source wallet.

[10-Dec-18 09:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Anyways I have wasted enough time and money on this. You guys can keep leeching off the Komodo community, i am done.

[10-Dec-18 09:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@hyperDEX in future if you want to make $ and don't want someone else to, then don't use MIT

{Reactions}
☝ 

[10-Dec-18 09:58 PM] PTYX#6840
We will open source Chameleon Desktop after 1 year on the market but i'm sure agama will be ready by then with the ledger plugin.

{Reactions}
😩 🙂 😐 

[10-Dec-18 09:59 PM] PTYX#6840
i know i know. alright wants it open source from the getgo

[10-Dec-18 10:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
>uses the least restrictive, non-imaginary license on his open-source code and then gets mad because someone made money from it

[10-Dec-18 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
need some advice on licenses

[10-Dec-18 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
What license would I use if I want no closed source project using it?

[10-Dec-18 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
and can I change code that is currently MIT to this or would it only apply to future code?

[10-Dec-18 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
MIT = I don't care wtf you do with it, just mention me somewhere

[10-Dec-18 10:04 PM] PTYX#6840
The internet says ```LGPL does not prevent commercial use in any way, see e.g. answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/439136.html Only a few open-source licenses limit by use case, and none of them are considered "free" by organisations like FSF. If you want to use a free license, the kind of split you want to achieve is usually done by having a strong free copyleft license, which does not prevent commercial use, but is off-putting to commercial users. Then your alternative could be worth purchasing for them, to avoid need to open-source their own code```

[10-Dec-18 10:06 PM] PTYX#6840
That is interesting because when we open source our wallets, that might be something we should do.

[10-Dec-18 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
I don't care about commercial use as long as it's OSS

[10-Dec-18 10:07 PM] PTYX#6840
I see what you're saying.

[10-Dec-18 10:09 PM] PTYX#6840
doesnt the GPL lincense force you to open source if you don't pay for it, but if you did pay for the code you can close source it.

[10-Dec-18 10:10 PM] Alright#0419
no idea, I thought I was alright with MIT on all of my code up until now

[10-Dec-18 10:11 PM] PTYX#6840
oh nvm

[10-Dec-18 10:11 PM] Alright#0419
Didn't really think about it, but now that I have, I'd rather projects that aren't contributing to the community(rather their pockets) aren't able to use it

[10-Dec-18 10:11 PM] PTYX#6840
```The GPL doesn't compel the user to distribute source code in general. It only compels them to distribute source code if they distribute compiled code, and even then only to the same people.```

[10-Dec-18 10:16 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm doing more research on that as well.

[10-Dec-18 10:22 PM] PTYX#6840
I've asked the magnum devs to add credit to the authors of the ledger implementation to @lukechilds and @hyperDEX.

[10-Dec-18 10:23 PM] PTYX#6840
It will be added in the code

[10-Dec-18 10:23 PM] Alright#0419
can't be arsed to deal with licenses, I'll just put effort into making sure any OSS solution out competes it's closed source counterpart

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Dec-18 10:26 PM] Alright#0419
IMO closed sourced solutions aren't working in the best interest of KMD. They would rather hinder the ecosystem's growth and get paid for it

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-Dec-18 10:40 PM] PTYX#6840
if we want major companies building on the Komodo network, we have to get used to the idea of closed source apps.

[10-Dec-18 10:40 PM] PTYX#6840
I believe there has to be a balance between the OSS and CS. One funds the other.

[10-Dec-18 10:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
One does not need to close source in order to get paid for it
this whole "debacle" is because someone paid for an open source solution

[10-Dec-18 10:43 PM] PTYX#6840
Right but many companies look at their apps, workflows, and systems as IP

[10-Dec-18 10:43 PM] PTYX#6840
so they wouldn't open source it. not initially at least. i'm sure there are some companies that do but that's not the trend i'm seeing with the majority.

[10-Dec-18 10:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'll let you all sort out the oxymoronish concept of dealing with cs IP dapps on an open source platform, I've got shit to help people with....

[10-Dec-18 10:45 PM] Alright#0419
Closed sourced apps aren't a problem. Keeping stuff that would help KMD ecosystem immensely closed source is.

{Reactions}
👆🏽 

[10-Dec-18 10:48 PM] PTYX#6840
when you compare oss and cs it's similar to socialism and capitalism. it doesn't work very well in the extremes. there has to be a balance. open source strengthens security and collaboration while close source brings in revenue.

[10-Dec-18 10:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or one could promote modern paradigms rather than trying to make the crypto space the same as the conventional space

@hyperDEX @lukechilds you might feel I should have handled things differently, and if you do I'd like the opportunity to sort it out and make it up to you. I want to give credit where it's due - how can we fix this? Let me know what I can do to make amends because I don't want any bad blood to be between us all. We're all part of the community and that's what's important.

[11-Dec-18 06:25 AM] Mylo#8306
jeeeezus.   what's important is not being a dick.  but if ppl are going to be dicks, i can betya i can be one of the top 5 biggest dicks in this discord.   but being a dick doesn't work.

here's why:
1.  I create some code like a front end to marketmaker.
2. i put an MIT derived license on it, calling it the _dont-be-a-dick_ license.
3. in the license, i put names of the dicks that cannot use this software in any capacity, open source, proprietary, network program, software as a service.
4. some equally dickish group picks up on the dont-be-a-dick license, does a little digging then finds out where these dicks work or their businesses.

you can't work with open source and be a dick. the code is more powerful than the dick.  the only dicks allowed are sociopath ceos of multinationals.  but these dicks do evil things, much more evil that what has happened in this channel.

Please sort it out and audit your licenses and abide by them if acting in a commercial capacity.  copyright  (& more importantly the infringements) can be bought by bigger fish in the litigation game and it all shits on the work of the ecosystem.

[11-Dec-18 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know about licenses etc, but after reading chat what I get is:
- MIT allows using the software/code with mention of it's source and authors with credit.
- Magnum intends to add the credit where it used the code from.
- Magnum is not open source?
- Better open source the code and then add the rewards library maybe?
- Until then maybe just hold on to that feature inaccessible until open sourced?

Just random thoughts just in case if there is really a respect for each others between @PTYX @hyperDEX and @lukechilds 

**Even if it sounds total unfair, it could possibly be done just for the good sake of friendship since you guys have been longer here enough working with each other.**

[11-Dec-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And open source or not or whatever license it is started with, I'd suggest @lukechilds to immediately make it's code repo private. If you really don't want others to use this code right now until yours own is done.

[11-Dec-18 07:26 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
is it possible to make reward accruing in sapling address?

[11-Dec-18 09:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@grewalsatinder Their wallet is closed source. They ripped whole sections of our code, which from what i understand with MIT they cannot do without including our file itself.

[11-Dec-18 09:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think it is a option to have it closed source when it affects peoples funds. That is why we did not do it in such a manner. We just did not think that anyone outside of the Komodo ecosystem would care about it and ones that do care within Komodo would have enough respect for others to actually wait for a official release from the team that came up with the solution.

[11-Dec-18 09:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Gordon Komodo No, it needs to go to a T address.

{Reactions}
👌 

[11-Dec-18 09:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX  right, I understand this part.
I guess the option I said should be possible.
It might sound unfair, but for keeping the goodwill to me it makes sense.
@hyperDEX  I still suggest you to make that repo private if you don't want anyone to use that code before you release and object.

[11-Dec-18 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
At least I put a relationship on top of monetary value.
And like since I know you and worked with you since almost the begening of the project, I would have most probably sactificed by taking this release action back, just to keep the relation healthy, despite being the chances keeping the feature available and public and gaining anything through it.

[11-Dec-18 09:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There should be a level of respect in this space. Self promotion and self interest is not greater than community interests.

[11-Dec-18 09:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
mistakes can happen. From both ends. How it is sorted is yet to see.

[11-Dec-18 09:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I would have been open with them using the code, if they had contacted us and was willing to wait till our release was out.
