Unstoppable Poker: CHIPS Exclusive - The Daily Chain
CHIPS is the currency that will be used for a decentralized, secure, on-chain application. The whole idea behind chips is that there’s a couple of protocols that work together to allow people to play poker with each other in a peer-to-peer fashion.

3 open positions for LABS notaries are up for grabs right now. Running a LABS NN is a great way to get started with blockchain development, basically forces you to learn. To get a spot, you must enter(and win) a provably fair "lottery". Deadline to enter is Oct 27 (1572202066). Inquire in #kmdlabs if you're interested. No cost to enter, just show you're competent or at least willing to learn.

edit: to be clear, this is for LABS notary positions, not KMD
