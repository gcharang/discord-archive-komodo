[yorklab#7270] 500kmd = 5 ish ZIlla. 1000kmd = about 10 ish ZIlla. Something like that. At least from the discussion so far.

[Hollowman9000#3344] Times 1,000,000 zilla

[Gordon Komodo#7477] 1 zilla = 1 zilla kapish?!

[13-Jul-18 02:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] is anyone staking tezos?

[Cryptodamus#6225] Hey I made a really bad infographic to explain the airdrop visually if someone wants:

[PTYX#6840] @sir where did you get those numbers from?

[13-Jul-18 03:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Its just a random example

[13-Jul-18 03:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Arbotrary numbers

[13-Jul-18 03:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Arbitrary *

[13-Jul-18 03:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Gotcha

[13-Jul-18 03:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Maybe someone armed with something more sophisticated than Microsoft powerpoint can mock up something better

[13-Jul-18 03:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Can I make it out of play dough?

[13-Jul-18 03:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Is this mineable?

[13-Jul-18 03:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I'm finally looking at it

[13-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I didn't have 500 kmd

[13-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Ok for all the new people, here's the deal with the airdrops: 

There are two types of airdrops for $ZILLA
1) Discord Airdrops

PTYX will initiate the command and then you just need to reply with your Zilla address generated from your agama wallet. These airdrops happen randomly throughout the day. 

2) Holding $KMD in your agama wallet.

There is an airdrop for KMD holders if they hold more than 500 KMD in their Agama wallet. The amount of zilla received will depend on total number of wallets and KMD held. 1M coins will be split between these holders. The snapshot for this airdrop is august 15th and coins are distributed about two weeks later.

[13-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] The last one was at 4 am

[13-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I don't wake up that early

[13-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Whats the process of what wallets get drops?

[13-Jul-18 03:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] We trying to exclude exchange wallets? Jumblr funds, DEX funds, SuperNET, etc?

[13-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Just between Jumblr, BOTS, and SuperNET, that's  5,697,750 KMD

[13-Jul-18 03:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[deathsgrip#5269] I would guess only if it’s in the agama wallet at time of snapshot

[13-Jul-18 03:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] also is it balance, or UTXO based @PTYX

[13-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Balance

[13-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I have a ton of btch

[13-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Balance in one address not multiple

[13-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Does that count?

[13-Jul-18 03:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] you can swap on bdex

[13-Jul-18 03:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] pretty sure it's going to be looking just at kmd 😃

[13-Jul-18 03:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I can't swap

[13-Jul-18 03:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] No one's buying

[13-Jul-18 04:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] and PTYX is it safe to say roughly 5 Zilla per 500 KMD?

[13-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[goldenman#7301] roughly yes. would be more Zillas than it according to number of less 500 KMD addresses.

[13-Jul-18 04:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Cool

[13-Jul-18 04:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Thanks for the airdrop ptyx

[13-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] If 5 zilla is 500 kmd

[13-Jul-18 04:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] PTYX I have a gift for you

[13-Jul-18 04:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[cheeweon#5786] @goldenman  hi . are you korean?

[13-Jul-18 04:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] okay I think it's finalized @PTYX here you go 😃

[13-Jul-18 04:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] just made that, but now I'm going to sleep

[13-Jul-18 04:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] later all

[13-Jul-18 04:43 AM] PTYX#6840
I don't know if you should include the amount of 5 per 500

[13-Jul-18 04:43 AM] PTYX#6840
Let's not distribute that yet

[13-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Any graphic work needs to be approved my our graphics manager before being published on any official capacity.

[13-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] My bad, wasn't meant as official capacity.

[13-Jul-18 04:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] When people see the graphic here they automatically assume it's valid. Also this channel is linked to the Komodo discord so it's not a good place to distribute graphics without approval. I can't delete messages on the Komodo side

[13-Jul-18 04:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Anywy good job

[13-Jul-18 04:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] maybe #deleted-channel ?

[13-Jul-18 04:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Exact

[13-Jul-18 04:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Got it 👍

[13-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[KomodoBo#8264] How could that happen?

[13-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] check your address on https://etherscan.io/

[13-Jul-18 10:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] also you weren't using the hola addon that was compromised right?

[13-Jul-18 10:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Herman @webworker01  all good,it was really weird, the password didnt work for like 80min and now it does

[and1_89#6578] Komodooooo

[13-Jul-18 11:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[pbca26#5430] just to clarify a few things
you don't need to move your funds from ledger if you only desire to receive zilla airdop
priv keys will be required only when you'd like to move zilla somewhere else
however if you follow the above scenario make sure to record pub address that holds your kmd at the time of the airdrop
also, you are not required to install or use agama at all
generate an address from the paper wallet then make a deposit

[13-Jul-18 11:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]#1300] Are there any instructions on how to become eligible for the airdrop?

[13-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Unknown just hold your KMD (500min) in some wallet that is not on exchange

[13-Jul-18 11:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[mo7881#6408] What is the Zil token used for?

[mo7881#6408] ignore that

[13-Jul-18 11:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
