Is this going to be a dico?

[28-Jun-18 11:41 AM] PTYX#6840
@jspook16 in January more or less we will run a small ICO round to fund the expansion of the Agama wallet we are redesigning now. The plan is to make an airdrop, deliver one app, one premium project, and then ICO. Afterwards I will make a second round of airdrops. I am working on the airdrop schemes now and will release the lite paper and our website 1.2 in the coming week.

[28-Jun-18 12:21 PM] jspook16#3059
@PTYX outstanding. You guys continue to do some amazing work.
