[03-Aug-18 09:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @Herman - i was finding that the captcha verification was timing out causing problems - a few page loads and a bit of patience later it went through

[03-Aug-18 09:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Okay, i had the same. I will try again

[03-Aug-18 09:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] 5th time succes

[03-Aug-18 10:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] yeah - not sure its a zilla thing really - seems like google captcha slow behind the scenes

[03-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] Is there an exchanger already available to buy and sell zilla?

[03-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] On HyperDEX and digitalprice.io

[03-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] But there isn't much volume since we haven't even made the first airdrop

[03-Aug-18 03:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] digitalprice.io  is not available

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] It does not let me neither withdraw nor deposit

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I see it fine. Are you using a VPN?

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Hmm I'll contact the dev

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] i think he means the wallet is disabled at the mo

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Oh I know why

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Itsbanned in some areas i think

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It must be due to the update that took place a few days ago

[03-Aug-18 03:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'll check

[03-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] "Deposit temporary disabled for this coin
Unstable version, waiting for Zilla developers response."

[03-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] "Withdrawal temporary disabled for this coin
Unstable version, waiting for Zilla developers response."

[03-Aug-18 03:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Ya i need a wallet fixed too lol

[03-Aug-18 03:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] That mainchain komodod still wont sync on the qt wallet

[03-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's due to an update that took place recently. It threw some of the clients out of whack. It seems some clients are banned

[03-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Which is the reason they won't sync

[03-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Ya

[03-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's being worked on but our spv is working fine

[03-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Ya agam is ok

[03-Aug-18 03:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Mastermind#1578] i am having issues syncing wallet on agma KMD syncs fine buy Zilla is not getting connections , it gets like 1 or 2 for few secs then back to 0

[03-Aug-18 03:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] .41a release?

[03-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] 0.2.41 is what it says on top

[03-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] So I can only sell and buy zilla through the hyperdex, no?

[03-Aug-18 03:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @jr.trump yes if there are orders available

[03-Aug-18 03:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] @Mastermind get the latest release. If that doesn't work then i have 1 more thing that will fix it

[jr.trump#1045] Ah ok

[03-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] And does anyone know if they are going to list more KMD tokens on digitalprice.io?

[03-Aug-18 03:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @NWhiskeyTango ok ill update and see if it works

[03-Aug-18 03:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @jr.trump i believe so

[03-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] I do not want to have to install the software, but I would like to buy Pearl Pay and Zilla and I do not know how

[03-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] pearl pay has its own DICO app you have to use

[03-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] available from thier  site

[03-Aug-18 03:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] did a small test amount and worked ok for me

[03-Aug-18 03:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] I do not want to install anything or run unknown software, so I want to buy in an online exchanger

[03-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] for Pearl Pay that is the only way - DICO  App built on KMD Atomic Swap

[03-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] Then I'll wait for this in an exchanger

[03-Aug-18 04:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] create a seed just for that account and move kmd from agama to that seed to purchase

[03-Aug-18 04:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it should be up and running again very soon. we are updating the remaining servers and the issue should be fixed with the latest wallet.
