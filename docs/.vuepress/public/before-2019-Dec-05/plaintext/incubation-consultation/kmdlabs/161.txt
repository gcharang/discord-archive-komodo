I didnt even think about LABS stuff until after sapling activated and I had main net up ... then it was a mad rush to get it working.... I think we are all good now though.

[15-Dec-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Been working on this, might be some info for @CrisF  and @jl777c 
Diffrences between stakedkomodo and official komodo. This is from doing a diff against the source of FSM and StakedChain/komodo/master.

-> Protocol version/ diffrent notary pubkeys
-> Notary tx's for staked notaries are maximum priority in the miner by default.
-> Komodo seeds are disabled for staked chains
-> Wallet filter for staked notaries (this is complex and needs its own docs, basics are in StakedNotary readme.)

-> MoMoM diffrences to what has been merged to FSM (do you want any of this @jl777c )
Extra set pf pubkeys possible (part of this was libscotts code, some of it is mine to make dPoW also work)
Cant send a migrate from a chain to itself
Cant send more than 1 million coins at once (goes with max money change so that you cant send coins that can never be imported)

-> There is a fix in mining.cpp that fixes setgenerate after the verus merge. 
In official komodo you cannot decrease threads with setgenerate  with staked you can.

-> Added segid to getsnapshot

[15-Dec-18 08:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
RPCs: 
-> getlastsegidstakes : gives a tally of stakes from chain tip back number of blocks you specify. Works better than get snapshot as you get an idea of what is actually being staked.
-> getiguanajson  : returns a valid JSON for the current ERA, so that iguana config is not seperate from komodod (saves human error whn changing keys and ports etc)
-> getnotarysendmany : returns a JSON object with all notary address's and the amount of coins specifed in input. Used for the notary stats and funding notaries.
-> cleanwallettransactions : this is in the readme, we know what it doesn. Patch is avalible for main net should anyone need this.
-> some changes to z_mergetoaddress (with the wallet filter I dont think these are needed and might just take it out)

Also there are ERA's: 
These just mean the notary pubkey arrays are in a 3 dimentional array so its much easier to have many many arrays and juts loop over them, makes changing keys very easy. Code much simpler and easier to follow. 

There is also a function in one of the komodo_.h files where on block receive it figures out what era its in, and creates an array of Raddress's into a global var, only updating the array after the era has finished. This allows the miner priotity to work across ERA's and also the code for the PIRATE exception can work like this. But I have not tested that, maybe its not accurate enough for such a consensus change.

[15-Dec-18 08:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I also did a major code clean up and removed anything we dont need... have to head out now will test in comming days. No major changes, mostly simplifying code (less lines) and removing functions that were added at varius times to test things that didnt work.

Thanks, @blackjok3r !

[15-Dec-18 08:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no worries... I figured now was the best time to do this. once this is all final, and we know exactly what main net wants and wat it doesn't I cna work on getting streamer back in 😄

[15-Dec-18 08:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Looking forward to that 😃

[15-Dec-18 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
was setpubkey rpc merged into FSM?

[15-Dec-18 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
if not, that's another

[15-Dec-18 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
need a different name for notary ERAs btw 😛

[15-Dec-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
as VRSC added eras which are totally unrelated

[15-Dec-18 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Could you please give a brief description of `setpubkey` so I can add it to what I'm working on?

[15-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
allows user to set `-pubkey=` without restarting the daemon

[15-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419

`Paradigemeridoos` a real toungue breaker there, haha.

[15-Dec-18 09:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
can we also rename the notary scripts to "staht.sh" and "stahp.sh" so it sounds like Mahky Mahk talks in the Depahted?

[15-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419

[15-Dec-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
U want all those?

[15-Dec-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No problem

[15-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how the extrapubkeys are managed

[15-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and maybe limiting to a million coins is too restrictive?

[15-Dec-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is using MAX_MONEY then it seems it is ok?

[15-Dec-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can't know what Max money will be on the import chain

[15-Dec-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So we chose a millions a cap

[15-Dec-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, ok, I guess the GUI can make sure import amount is sane

[15-Dec-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so that change would be needed

[15-Dec-18 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll have an in depth look at these things tomorrow, and see how easy/hard it is to make them work, some of the RPCs might depend on other code this was a quick read through to document what we ended up changing before it was all lost, I'd like not to deviate from official source too much

[15-Dec-18 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One thing I know is apart from the wallet filter, most of it is backwards compatible

[15-Dec-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
And the array of RAddresss could be calced on demand, rather than being inna global

[15-Dec-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
But it seemed to be more efficient to just dp it the once during sync for each set of keys

[15-Dec-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is not easy to do, not needed

[15-Dec-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
adding address calculation to inner loops will slow things down and things are slow enough already

[15-Dec-18 10:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Agreed... It took a lot of iterations to get this stuff even close enough to fst to be viable.

[15-Dec-18 10:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll msg u tomorrow about it later on and see what think.. Some it is very simple and quite fast but I'd like some advice about it

[15-Dec-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810

I am all the edge cases: on another machine, production KMD, some weeks ago, I generated the address for the kmdlabs notary I run here.

Using Agama portable on that machine I claimed KMD rewards. Guess where Agama decided to send all the funds? Yes, the notary address. Now I don't seem to be able to send the funds anywhere.

Guys there is an issue with iguana for split fund. You will need to send the balance to youself to make it work again. I made this small script to help the process. From observations so far it seems to fix it permenantly after sending balance, some problem with using a utxo from before the fork is my best guess. 
```
#!/bin/bash
komodo-cli -ac_name=$1 sendtoaddress RSuXRScqHNbRFqjur2C3tf3oDoauBs2B1i $(komodo-cli -ac_name=$1 getbalance) "" "" true
```
use like this:
`./sendtoself CFEKING`

If this continues to be an issue, I will update our wallet resetter with the fix I have for mainnet.

its been o 100 the whole time pretty much

restarting the staker now ... maybe it wasnt on latest or something 🤷

[16-Dec-18 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your deamon is locked when not mining?

[16-Dec-18 05:41 AM] CrisF#3405
It was staking.  getbalance locked and I saw 100POS.  Wasn't able to connect again to try mining.

[16-Dec-18 05:41 AM] CrisF#3405
It was fine staking and when I checked this morning the above.

[16-Dec-18 05:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Wasn't locking when staking yesterday evening.

[16-Dec-18 05:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
