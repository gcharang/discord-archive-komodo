Notary can do this while running - but it will mess with the wallet a bit

[21-Jun-19 08:43 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
- unless it is the notary address you are withdrawing from?

@Exile13 
easiest way is import your wif key on a 2nd node, but if your LABS NN is the only node that run LABS, then here's what I  would do:
- import your WIF with importprivkey.
- send out the necessary LABS amount from your imported address (at this point your wallet has 2 Raddies, 1 is your nota addy and the other is your newly imported, if you use `sendtoaddress` the inputs will be automatically chosen based on your amounts, so to make sure your tx uses the 2nd addy's utxo as input, you have to use `createrawtransaction` , `signrawtransaction` then `sendrawtransaction`) .
- now if you want to remove the 2nd wif key you just imported, stop LABS daemon, delete LABS wallet.dat (back it up first just in case), then relaunch with `./start.sh`

ok, i stopped `StakedNotary`, then installed `staked` imported priv key and sent with success, now i went back to `StakedNotary` to `./start.sh` and the master errors.

[21-Jun-19 10:12 PM] Exile13#4458
i remembered that i had to build zcutil about 2 weeks ago, so i went to `/komodo` and ran `make clean` then `./zcutil/build.sh` and got another error in the `libbitcoin_server_a-miner.o` makefile

need help i broke it

[22-Jun-19 04:57 AM] Exile13#4458
is it because i imported a priv key to `staked`?

[22-Jun-19 05:00 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Exile13 , 
are you on your NN server?

[22-Jun-19 05:05 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sometimes you need to  ./start a couple of times. If after 3 attempts, no joy - delete komodo folder to allow fresh rebuild

[22-Jun-19 05:43 AM] Exile13#4458
@CrisF  yes

[22-Jun-19 05:43 AM] Exile13#4458
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator run something like `rm komodo`?

[22-Jun-19 05:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, did you ./start.sh a few times like smk762 suggested?

[22-Jun-19 05:44 AM] Exile13#4458
`./start.sh` like 4 times now

[22-Jun-19 05:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Are you trying torun `staked` or `StakedNotary`?

[22-Jun-19 05:45 AM] Exile13#4458
`StakedNotary`

[22-Jun-19 05:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Cool, wasn't sure what you meant here ```stopped StakedNotary, then installed staked imported priv key```

[22-Jun-19 05:47 AM] Exile13#4458
i didnt know if importing a priv key to my NN would mess anything up, so i stopped the NN, installed `staked`, and then imported the priv key there

[22-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Exile13#4458
but now the NN wont start

[22-Jun-19 06:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
privkey etc should be in config.ini, and imported auto

[22-Jun-19 06:00 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
whats happeing is either build or launch is failing.

`I'm thinking of the environment`
If that's true, then you should be advocating the banning of all SHA256 mining

Wondering about getting a cheap ass non-arm board and running a node from here.

Cool @Exile13 !  
I've found a couple boards while rearranging things here, so hardware is good.
Figure I'll get them going over the summer, or pick up a non-arm.  Expecting to get some more bandwidth to put to use soon.

how to get the wallet?

[23-Jun-19 01:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
There is no wallet, need CLI.

[23-Jun-19 01:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In any case if u have coins why not staking them? You can't do that with a wallet It requires cli

[23-Jun-19 04:50 AM] zaza68#4573
What you mean by CLI ?

[23-Jun-19 05:20 AM] PHBA2061#2530
command line interface or komodo-cli

[23-Jun-19 05:49 AM] zaza68#4573

[23-Jun-19 05:53 AM] PHBA2061#2530
sorry but it's not funny, LABS was recently launched, that's  the reason why CLI wallet is the only option for now

[23-Jun-19 06:16 AM] zaza68#4573

[23-Jun-19 06:55 AM] PHBA2061#2530
what is your point, if you don't need to store a coin then why you need a wallet ?

[23-Jun-19 06:56 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[23-Jun-19 07:17 AM] zaza68#4573

[23-Jun-19 07:21 AM] zaza68#4573

Its fine for holding, but if you want to stake or join in with comps, you should use CLI

The older Agama it was in had some trouble. The new one was only reacently released. We've been pretty busy with NN season change etc, so a bit behind here. Also, not everyone is awake 24hrs a day.

While I understand that most people never see most things the way I do, here's my unofficial random 2 cents:
I understand that there are investors, markets, and all of that; however,........
LABS is a technical testing ground and if you need a point and click wallet for it, maybe it's not for you 🤷🏽

{Reactions}
👆 

[23-Jun-19 08:11 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
same thing across crypto. Investors resist the tech, just want the `gainz`. LABs is here for those that want to learn, but nothing to stop wallet holders and traders.

[23-Jun-19 08:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
you'll get better gainz learning how to stake in CLI and compete in challenges tho

[23-Jun-19 08:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm real tempted to turn the old dude in the hawaian shirt into a meme 😂

[23-Jun-19 08:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for my other 3 cents, to round it off to a nickle:
If you want to invest in LABS __and__ feel that a GUI wallet is needed, feel free to hire a GUI dev 🙂

[23-Jun-19 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that investment would be greatly appreciated!

[23-Jun-19 08:53 AM] zaza68#4573
smk762 you can stake on agama wallet 2 but did get your piont
ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  feel free to hire a dev team for build a wallet you ar missin a lot there !?!  LABS have a wallet you can download it its calld agama wallet. btw i will never donate to a crypto founder you can better donate the puur people !

[23-Jun-19 08:55 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
invest != donate
maybe some puur ppl can earn by doing dev ;)
btw, LABs doesnt stake like the KMD 5% rewards. you need to pass the `setgenerate true 0` RPC command

[23-Jun-19 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`LABS have a wallet you can download it its calld agama wallet.`
@zaza68 that is a 3rd party wallet that may or may not work with any given coin as that 3rd party sees fit 🤷🏽

[23-Jun-19 08:57 AM] zaza68#4573
yeah yeah i know the hole website only about staking labs
