Mine does.

[26-Sep-19 08:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
same result here. MYLO6 returns 3 txids, MYLO returns pubkey error - confirmed it is set in htop. Also tested `oracleslist` which returns empty (not error).

[26-Sep-19 08:48 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
assetchains.json has 
`    "ac_ccenable": "226,236",` 
for CFEKMYLO. Safe to assume that tokens module is not activated on that chain.

Ahh!!  Thanks @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator 💎
That solves it then ⭐

[26-Sep-19 09:00 AM] CrisF#3405
I just got up to reading `-as_ccenable` on the train on the way back.

I've PR'd the docs to include the tokens eval code (242) 👍🏽

Is it safe to try on `CFEKOD` or `CFEKAPOW`?  If so I'll do on weekend.  Need server for `tCHIPS` now.

[26-Sep-19 11:04 AM] Nabob#5004
cfekod seems my chain fekd, see no notarizaion

[26-Sep-19 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely because it hasn't been mined

[26-Sep-19 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
joker set it up for a test and I shut down the miner while he's gone

[26-Sep-19 11:06 AM] Nabob#5004
ahh that makes sense

[26-Sep-19 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I figured if he's not home to see what he was hoping to see then it will not matter if it happens or not 😛

[26-Sep-19 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is hoping he's enjoying the well deserved time off_

[26-Sep-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there a tx generator running on `CFEKOD`?  That is the OnDemand chain right?

[26-Sep-19 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, it's on-demand

[26-Sep-19 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
afaik, there's no auto-tx running for it

[26-Sep-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll try a transaction and see if that livens things up...

[26-Sep-19 11:29 AM] CrisF#3405
btw, @Nabob, I'm seeing this in iguana TV```[LABS] : Nabob has submit spent utxo, ignore them
```

[26-Sep-19 11:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Did you start mining @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢?  Or maybe another miner is up?

[26-Sep-19 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
I sent a transaction and a block happened.

[26-Sep-19 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I sent a transaction and a block happened.`
that's how on-demand works 😛

[26-Sep-19 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I know :abusedsmily: , but needs a miner doesn't it?

[26-Sep-19 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
btw, @jorian, this is coming up in ig TV now `OD` moved.

[26-Sep-19 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
```[CFEKOD] : jorian has submit spent utxo, ignore them
```

[26-Sep-19 11:40 AM] jorian#4555
how often

[26-Sep-19 11:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
with on-demand, any node that is set to generate a block will sit "idle" waiting for a tx to happen
once that tx is in the mempool, then they begin to mine until the mempool is empty

[27-Sep-19 11:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@Nabob  
You cannot do that with the current code, It doesnt matter if your node  has a 1Gb wallet.dat or a 100kb wallet.dat. Or if it has 1 utxo or 1000. It caches the first 50 in the daemon, and gives iguana one at a time. If you are submitting spent utxos, your node cannot enter recvmask. The latest updates to the daemon and iguana, should stop that happening, unless my fix didnt fix it :abusedsmily:

Hi @Bernz - Selling LABS 👋,
Still no word back from Delta about listing.
I'll send a follow-up mail over the weekend.

[27-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
I appreciate the effort! I've tired of waiting on them and made my own spreadsheet 😅 as it should be

[27-Sep-19 02:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, that sucks, but like you say, might be for the best.

[27-Sep-19 02:28 PM] CrisF#3405
They were quite fast last time I sent a mail.

Was thinking of a utility coin (vote in this case), but could be used for coupons or dodgey payments (not my recommendation, but a danger), etc.
`CertaintyCoin`, haha

[28-Sep-19 04:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm... how would `lock & burn` work...

Another CC on my list to look into!

[28-Sep-19 04:43 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm vaguely remembering that I was told that CC couldn't use `Z`-transaction.  Do you think that `Gateways`, `Payments` and `Z`-transactions could be combined somehow for a `Zero-Knowledge Vote`?
I'll start looking into the 2 CCs now.

[28-Sep-19 04:43 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that would lock it and can be released to burn address... or released to another contract like rewards... not sure if it'd do exactly what you want tho

[28-Sep-19 04:44 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
CCs and ztx dont play nice.

[28-Sep-19 04:45 AM] CrisF#3405
Am I remembering correctly that a CC can't run on a chain with privacy enabled?

[28-Sep-19 04:46 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
not sure, could be ok if allows R-addr also, but wont work using z-addr afaik

{Reactions}
🙏 

[28-Sep-19 05:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CC's cannot use z-tx, also CC cannot take an output of a Z->T tx either... So you cannot spend a Z-tx to a CC vout, if that makes sense.

[28-Sep-19 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@LabsAssistant  Please update using `start.sh` the update is to `blackjok3r` branch of SuperNET, not the daemon. 
This should fix the "<node> has submit spent utxo, ignore them" errors.  
It seems some nodes get this more than others, which is why we see counts vary by the amount they are. Only way to know is to test it. So please update ASAP and DM me when you have done so.

?

[28-Sep-19 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No... not sure what that is for, I was just going to comment out the print...

[28-Sep-19 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem to actually cause any problems... But havent investigated it in detail.

[28-Sep-19 07:19 AM] gcharang#6833
oh, you have seen it too?

[28-Sep-19 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes all my nodes are printing it constantly... my main net notary is on dev branch and is spamming it like crazy for weeks.

[28-Sep-19 07:20 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, same experience

[28-Sep-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I'll check the gitblame to who added the print, might be a debug print that was left in by accident.

[28-Sep-19 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or maybe its an actual problem.

[28-Sep-19 07:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I've had that a lot too.

[28-Sep-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
looks lke debug prints to me, jl added them 3 months ago. I will ask him about it. Seems to me we can just comment it out.

[28-Sep-19 08:28 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
despite all the effort put into backend voodoo and magic, is it wrong to still be so irrationally exited about all the pretty colors?

So there is basically no possibility to use CC on the KMD blockchains with privacy enabled, right?

[29-Sep-19 08:14 AM] johnwhitestar#1227
And what about voting there is a specific module for it? Is it possible to vote without paying fees for it?

[29-Sep-19 08:28 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm trying to figure that out.
```CC's cannot use z-tx, also CC cannot take an output of a Z->T tx either... So you cannot spend a Z-tx to a CC vout, if that makes sense.```

I don't think that there is voting module at the moment.

It may be possible to vote without paying fees.  Best to ask about this back in #cc-general
