why do you need the 24 words passphrase if you have your compressed WIF already ? If that's for using the `genkomodo.php` then here's the tweak:
- replace `$k` in `$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKey($k)` (line 141) with your private key in hex format https://github.com/DeckerSU/komodo_scripts/blob/master/genkomodo.php#L141
- ofc you'll need to convert your compressed WIF to the private key, here's how:
convert your WIF from base58 to hex, using a tool like this (offline of course) http://lenschulwitz.com/base58
once you obtain your WIF in  hex format , for example :
```BC10A4928997C1A45BE602806F3DA292206F66EB4BFD36FBE431EB0DBFE4CC414C01168A5381```
remove the first 2 characters (BC = 188 in hex which is the wif type of KMD) & the last 10 characters (`01`-this is the compression byte and `168A5381` - this is the first 4 bytes of the double SHA256 checksum of all the previous bytes). Then you'll have:
```10A4928997C1A45BE602806F3DA292206F66EB4BFD36FBE431EB0DBFE4CC414C```
This is the private key that you'll need to insert in the first step

run it
enter KMD, BTC, GAME, EMC2, GIN, or SUQA wif and
it will output KMD, BTC, GAME, EMC2, GIN, and SUQA wifs with matching pubkey```

awesome guys, thanks

[27-May-19 10:26 AM] jorian#4555
i was going to investigate myself but this is easier

[27-May-19 10:26 AM] SHossain#0007
seed works as additional layer of backup. you can also export WIF from a seed, but can't do other way

[27-May-19 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
however, iguana works with both

[27-May-19 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
if you already have your NN server ready and securely setup, you can just create and import the privkey and validate address to get pubkey and all other required info

[27-May-19 10:28 AM] SHossain#0007
**Security** is important in your server as the seed/WIF will be stored in plain-text inside iguana dir

I use the "old" way, because with Decker's method some of the addys I go for would take years (because of the extra steps involved in using phrases)

same here, I also use the old oclvanitygen, but because I failed to compile Decker's files 😂

[27-May-19 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
same here, I put 6 cards back into one of the 13 card boards and stuck it on a shelf

[27-May-19 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I was actually surprised that the dual core held up with 6 cards
runs pretty close to maxed out, but it's "just enough" to run them for oclvanitygen

[27-May-19 11:04 AM] And1_89#6578
it's not intended to use wif, only passphrases.

but if you want to use WIF change line:

$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKey($k);


on

$bitcoinECDSA->setPrivateKeyWithWif($passphrase);

@kolo can you clear up the conversation we had yesterday in pm? Specifically in relation to the 2nd pubkey and not importing it yet.

[27-May-19 12:17 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
Hello everyone. We are configuring the node and it seems that we have a problem with HUSH3. When we try to see the debug log, it does not exist, it has not been started correctly. I am also seeing that in assetchains.old there is no initialization for HUSH3.

[27-May-19 12:17 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
Is this something that already happened to anyone else?

[27-May-19 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Carlos Crypto Economy hush has its own repository (<https://github.com/MyHush/hush3>) and is built as an external chain

[27-May-19 12:20 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
I have found right now this:

Yeah the assetchains.old needs to be updated to add HUSH3

I believe SHossain was going to submit the PR

[27-May-19 12:37 PM] Decker#3767
`assetchains.old` is not intended to launch 3rd party coins. why nobody asked to add GIN or GAME into it? 😃

[27-May-19 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the assetchains.old needs to be updated to add HUSH3`
Since HUSH has its own repo and own schedule, I'm not sure that's a good idea

[27-May-19 12:40 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
We are having a little problem with CHIPS too, it seems that there is no peers? - "connect() to 5.9.253.195:57777 failed after select(): Connection refused (111)"

[27-May-19 12:40 PM] Decker#3767
and there is an other reason, why shouldn't do that. bcz on different systems hush3 daemon binary have different paths. mean, on my node it can be like `/home/decker/hush3/src/komodod` and on other it can be `/home/user/hush3mylovelycoin/src/komodod` )

[27-May-19 12:42 PM] Decker#3767

Great, that is what I needed, thanks!!

[27-May-19 12:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah fair call. I assumed since VRSC was in there, HUSH3 would sit in there as well. I was wrong!

[27-May-19 12:47 PM] Decker#3767
You can made your own `start_daemons.sh` script and place there commands to start all daemons.

[27-May-19 12:48 PM] Decker#3767
It's a better way. Bcz only you knows paths and other info related to your system.

[27-May-19 12:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I did that, mostly because some chains work best with different pause timings

i did a PR to jl777 branch to add HUSH3 start command on `assetchains.old`. it was there. but, recently with some other merges, i guess that was removed.

the guides we have is for general purpose only and shows only how to use them. it doesn't cover all different way to start, compile or manage. use this guide as standard and make it better with your own spice

[27-May-19 12:57 PM] Carlos Crypto Economy#7861
no problem, knowing it we can make our own script to run it

[27-May-19 12:59 PM] SHossain#0007
i broke down `assetchains.old` script to 2 different scripts just to make it easy on the system and that makes operation smoother for me.

blackjoker, dwy, webworker01 and decker helped a lot in season 2 with their scripts and optimizations.

[27-May-19 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007

Just remember, on your path to optimization:
If it makes the network better, share it unquestionably; but, imo, if it makes your personal performance optimal above others, give consideration to your income and longevity as well

no need for `rpcbind=127.0.0.1` because it is default anyway

iirc, there will eventually be 2 "networks" one for ecosystem and one for external
