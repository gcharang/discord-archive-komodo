Ah only thing just noticed is to mine 1 block of TXSCLCC. I assume thats a gen=1 parameter when I start its daemon ?

[08-Apr-19 02:46 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true 1`

[08-Apr-19 02:47 PM] PHBA2061#2530
`komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate false` to stop mining

[08-Apr-19 02:47 PM] newvulcan#4719

[08-Apr-19 03:41 PM] gt#2812
we are getting double time notarizations

[08-Apr-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You need to decode the opreturn

[08-Apr-19 03:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
They are most likely not notarizing the same block but just confirmed in the same block

BEER is flowing albeit slowly, but PIZZA and TXSCLCC are jammed. Best practice to  get them unglued? :troll_hmm:

j(ŁϨe>�~�H�����{��    AI�z�I�BKMD are "KMD", but why the rest are  � ? or is it my browser that renders them into question mark 😕

thank you all for the answers

[08-Apr-19 04:40 PM] newvulcan#4719
Have I missed a step or missed seeing some information during installation. Should I have wallet addresses for PIZZA, BEER, KMD and TXSCLCC ?

[08-Apr-19 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the same address for all

[08-Apr-19 04:41 PM] newvulcan#4719
Ahh, right thanks 😃

[08-Apr-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the decode code is in the daemon itself... The RPC I made today allows you to decode it for any given KMD block.

[08-Apr-19 04:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but I had to make it skipp pizza and txsclk because they let anyone notarize and make the data output loop stuupid

[08-Apr-19 04:56 PM] newvulcan#4719
Ok, thats funded PIZZA and BEER from faucet, and waiting on a block for TXSCLCC. I'm assuming I have to fund my BTC address and my KMD address to be complete ?

[08-Apr-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
you don't need a BTC node nor BTC address for testnet of NN. BTC address and node are required if you are elected as Notary Node

[08-Apr-19 04:57 PM] phm87#7395
but yes you should fund KMD, PIZZA, BEER and TXSCLCC

[08-Apr-19 04:58 PM] phm87#7395
about PIZZA and BEER, I heard that there is a faucet (or ppl here can send some to you) and for TXSCLCC, you can mine some with 1 thread of CPU

[08-Apr-19 04:59 PM] phm87#7395
``komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate true 1`` to start mining
``komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCLCC setgenerate false`` to stop mining

Yep I used Atomic Explorer to fund PIZZA and BEER. For the life of me I can't remember how to tell I've mined a block from the log files.

[08-Apr-19 05:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I can txblast BEER 🍺

[08-Apr-19 05:03 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you wont be able to split it though becuse you need to merge it first 😂

[08-Apr-19 05:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
how many utxo will you blast typically for a dwy attack ? In case of being attacked, can I just merge it by self sendtoaddress, or the tx size will be too big if I do that way ?

[08-Apr-19 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure... to be effective against the entire network, he may need to send a million tx's

[08-Apr-19 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to take out a single notary a few hundred k would be enough...

[08-Apr-19 05:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
merging small amounts is pie with any method

[08-Apr-19 05:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but once it gets over some threshold... you cant send the tx in blocks becaus they are full... its a very expenisive attack though... only really possible on a chin liek BEER

{Reactions}
👍 

[08-Apr-19 05:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
doing sendtoaddress with minconfs=1 would likely do it... but will also eat all your split utxos to notarize

[08-Apr-19 07:13 PM] Mylo#8306
dwy attack is what csw calls satoshis shotgun.   dwy came up with it sometime in 2018.  satoshi shotgun was revealed sometime this year.

I have only 11 utxo but wallet is >19M now

[08-Apr-19 07:22 PM] zatJUM#9924
utxo number in stats scripts seems to be inacurate

[08-Apr-19 07:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
utxos don't correlate to wallet size, wallet carries all history size

[08-Apr-19 07:29 PM] zatJUM#9924
of course, but `listunspent | jq length` shows >2000 and `stats` shows 11

[08-Apr-19 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
stats is only showing the utxos iguana can use
