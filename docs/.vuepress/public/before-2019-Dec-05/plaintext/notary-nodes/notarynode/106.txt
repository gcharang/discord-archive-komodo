don't store/accept anything to your wallet if it does not come from yourself?

I think this is needlessly complicated ... All it really needs is anm RPC to switch it on or off...

[08-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and block everything

[08-Apr-19 12:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the wallet code is checking all tx anyway sop I added an extra filter.

[08-Apr-19 12:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
but its not very well made, does work though.

ok, one last question (i hope) the pubkey should be the btcpubkey?

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No, it should be the pubkey of your KMD address. BTCpubkey is for mainnet

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
testnet is notarising AC's(BEER, PIZZA, TXSCLCC) to KMD

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] MadCryptoHead#3559
Ok, the ine that it generates when I create the wallet

[08-Apr-19 01:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They're the only 4 chains you need to worry about

[08-Apr-19 01:06 PM] blackjok3r#3181
BTC or whatever... the address is generated by hashing it with a prefix

Ok, got the right software all in place, done a reboot and everything appears to have started with no errors except for the last bit (is not official notary). However although I though I had put my details into testnet, I hadn't, so I've just put a PR in - hopefully with that enabled everything should work 游
