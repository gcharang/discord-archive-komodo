Hi guys one quick Q... all of the notary nodes put a transaction with a checkpoint into bitcoin right?

[04-Oct-18 09:12 PM] Hermes#6934
basically that's how you notarize...you take turns doing it.

[05-Oct-18 12:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a randomly chosen process, out of 64 nodes 13 are chosen in a way that is so unpredictable that you cannot know who will participate until it already happened

[05-Oct-18 04:41 AM] Hermes#6934
thanks @blackjok3r ✌

anyone else noticing EMC2 server stops at the drop of a hat?

[05-Oct-18 12:57 PM] NNoperator#3835
I think it may fault when I try to getinfo from the same terminal that I started it up with, but I don't think that makes sense.

[05-Oct-18 12:59 PM] NNoperator#3835
What are the debug  "kimoto gravity well" prints about?

[05-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
kimoto gravity well is a diff adjustment algo

[05-Oct-18 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
often called KGW, it's one of the older and more common ones

[05-Oct-18 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's not "good or safe" anymore, most modern coins use LWMA, but changing DAA's is not easy

[06-Oct-18 05:00 PM] NNoperator#3835
Is this something to be concerned over:    got scriptPubKey[25] via rawtransaction ht.391270 f9d52af8d66d2842af18733823137d053f05b45ae323b978de537d59d95793a9
HUSH cant get scriptPubKey for ht.391270 txi.1 vin.0
(tx.1: ) HUSH ht.391270
??

[06-Oct-18 05:01 PM] NNoperator#3835
why is HUSH  printing that it can't get scriptPubKeys  ?

[06-Oct-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
no... those are debug prints

[06-Oct-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
they would be transactions that done have a scriptpubkey

[06-Oct-18 05:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it iterates through all transactions to find the valid notarisation

[06-Oct-18 10:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@NNoperator it's normal debug output, only on notary nodes. It's hard to know which debug output you are going to need 😃

[06-Oct-18 10:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
as long as the `notarized` height in `getinfo` output is a recent height, everything is working normally

[07-Oct-18 12:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
i see that it's actually printed for all nodes, and it might confuse some people

[07-Oct-18 01:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
On staked, every MoMoM import TX has a scriptpubkey so when yo uget a block with hundreds of import TX in it, it spams that for a long time 😂

[07-Oct-18 01:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I ended up removing the print I think as is doesnt seem useful once you know notarisations work

[07-Oct-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, removed that print. will eventually migrate to all branches

Steps to update VRSC. Every step is important and must be followed. Otherwise, the update will not work. When you start the daemon after compiling updated source, the chain will re-sync from fresh (this is normal). To verify the update is done find `"VRSCversion": "0.4.0",` using `getinfo` call.
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-openssl-dev bsdmainutils automake curl

Thats fine ... it just means your node broadcast the TX after it was already confirmed, that happens on AC quite a lot, due to ondemand blocks.

[17-Oct-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think you will notice a lot more errors you never seen before now -25 and -26 are mostly gone 😉

src/cheatcatcher.cpp there's the magic from miket of verus!

[18-Oct-18 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
watch out, that thing will detect you staking the same utxo in multiple wallets, which many people might do accidentally

[18-Oct-18 02:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you imported some VRSC addr with utxo into another machine, and both stake (which is the default), the cheat catcher will steal your stake rewards

{Reactions}
😯 

[18-Oct-18 03:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
latest VRSC turns off staking by default, I just learned, which mediates the issue. You must turn on staking on the node you want to stake

@dukeleto Congratulations and thank you very much for the dPoW-Conf integration. Currently, the fix is in `master` branch. I have tested and it working in AC. Within the next couple of hours, I'll also test in KMD chain (currently syncing blocks from 0).
This is quite a development. Indeed a needed one for the safety of users and exchanges.

**How dPoWConf works?**
dpowconf: `0, 1, n` values in `gettxout`, `listunspent` or `getblock` call
first stage
```
  "confirmations": 0,
```
2nd stage 
```
  "confirmations": 1,
  "rawconfirmations": 1,
```
then after 5 KMD block confirm
```
  "confirmations": 1,
  "rawconfirmations": 5,
```
after 12 KMD block cnfirm when a BTC notarization happen
```
  "confirmations": 12,
  "rawconfirmations": 12,
```
exchanges can use, when `confirmations` is not `0` or `1` but `n` to allow withdraw or credit deposited funds. that means those txs are dpowed and secure.
