There is no official list or map of candidates, all are made by contributing members. We were told we should not affect candidates (to be fair) by listing/non listing them, so we rely on what people contribute. Thanks those are really good. The most fair method I assume.

[14-Apr-19 05:18 PM] kolo#1111
Map is tricky thing as there is no loction of node known, all data is actually contact data of hosting company registred anywhere.

I wonder how's the Gbit in Panama? I didn't realise how big the AR region is.. Maybe SH is a better bet than AR...

`My main goal with choosing SH as a region is to expand the notary network to an underserved area. `
`My reason for choosing Israel as well.`
I like that and believe it's an important thing for folks to take note of....

`does he not have a keyboard to type here?`
yes, but it only usually works when he wants to complain in #talk-mining that no one wants to rewrite the code yiimp/yaamp he already has for him

[14-Apr-19 08:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
is that the closed source one?

[14-Apr-19 08:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
`he is busy I think and it is another guy who told me this`

[14-Apr-19 08:06 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
`is that the closed source one?` not really, just the algo solving bits for equihash are a closely guarded "secret" that isn't shared unless someone likes you

[14-Apr-19 08:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
`just the algo solving bits for equihash` <- isn't that like 80% of a pool's point?
