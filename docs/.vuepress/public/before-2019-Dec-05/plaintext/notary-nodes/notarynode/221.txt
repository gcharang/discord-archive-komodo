Hmm, after `git pull ` and `make` still getting ```error code: -32601```

Thanks you 🙏

Please, stop annoying everyone around. Be civilized. Thats not only to dwy, but for all. Annoyance itself is violation of rules here. I will ban for this, no jokes.

[06-Aug-19 03:59 PM] kolo#1111
Ban is not the solution I would like to use, but if people will ignore patient requests to stop - we will have no second option

[06-Aug-19 04:00 PM] kolo#1111
BTC's per requests sent. Everyone else will get later today when fee will be lower. Sorry for the delay, waited for funds

[06-Aug-19 04:15 PM] zatJUM#9924
Will you send dust as told a few days ago?

[06-Aug-19 04:19 PM] blackjok3r#3181
with the new iguana @kolo  wil be able to fund us directly in 10ksat utxos... it will save vast amounts of BTC in txfees

Not yet dust, just big chunk of btc this time. But later ready to use dust

Just to mention that I promised some % of my NN profit to CHIPS, it will be sent when I do my accounting once every 3 months. So for this third quarter it should be in october.

[08-Aug-19 05:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Strob make sure to not send funds to compromised agama addresses

[08-Aug-19 10:38 PM] Strob#3417
Which address should I use to contribute ton CHIPS?

[08-Aug-19 11:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it should be pinned in the CHIPS discord

[09-Aug-19 01:38 AM] Strob#3417
Ok it looks like we are waiting for a confirmed address.

[09-Aug-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
believe @blackjok3r volunteered to manage it, not sure he's still doing it though

[09-Aug-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
this was months and months ago when jl asked someone to step up to manage it

[09-Aug-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I had a bounty address but we never did anything with it... @jorian  was handleing it

[09-Aug-19 12:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Apologies, I should have posted this in this channel as well
```For all NN's, I'd suggest holding onto your funds for now. I've tried to get in contact with Jorian to double check the address for donations but havent heard anything yet. 
We currently have 2 addresses for donations, the one listed in the pinned message(meant for mining donations) and the original bounty donation address(listed on the CHIPS trello). Both of these addresses are escrowed by @jorian```

[09-Aug-19 12:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
This was posted in the CHIPS discord (by me)

[09-Aug-19 01:05 PM] phm87#7395
Sigh ... I already sent coins to the old donation address. A part of txds are on my github. I hope that it will be fine and resolved

[09-Aug-19 01:23 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Dont worry, the funds are safu. I believe Jorian is just taking some down time atm

I can give you a pubkey if you want?

it was really easy to get working.. .I just made 1 node on AWS then coipied it X times and wrote some scripts to genereate the pubkeys

[11-Aug-19 07:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you will need a privkey to launch a node...unless I restart it with another one added... which isnt that difficult

[11-Aug-19 07:12 PM] blackjok3r#3181
or you can give it a go to launch your own network...

This node is down, but should work just fine. Will DM you privkey

[13-Aug-19 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I believe I must have spent the most money in second season of Notary Nodes, just by choosing to stick with AWS longer enough think our nodes will get best outputs, which is not true.

[13-Aug-19 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was wondering about my expenses for just server hosting etc for past year which were only did for Notary Nodes, and it all totals to about 40,000+ NZD

[13-Aug-19 08:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```Hostings    Period From    Period To    Total
AWS+OVH+DO    Jan 2018    Aug 2019    $33,595.77
Hetzner    Jan 2018    Aug 2019    $7,396.98
        SUM    $40,992.75```

[13-Aug-19 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That's for 2 nodes on AWS mostly

[13-Aug-19 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
DO is Digital Ocean while doing some quick testing of automation scripts etc.

[13-Aug-19 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the hardest part for last season for me was to not to change the hosting provider just because single reason.

[13-Aug-19 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
IP Address

[13-Aug-19 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
changing that has to dealt with a lot of pain while the whole network propagates to use new IP

[13-Aug-19 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In my opinion, for ANY current and future Notary Nodes, I'd highly recommend to host your OWN HARDWARE in a local Co-location

[13-Aug-19 08:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
For BEST outcomes to my opinion.

[13-Aug-19 08:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because that's exactly what I did in my firs season of Notary Nodes

[13-Aug-19 08:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my monthly expenses were 4th of what it was in second season

[13-Aug-19 08:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
running own hardware node, locally in NZ, colocated, with a shity internet speed of almost 10 Mbps or sometimes even lower, and my node still did well in season 1

[13-Aug-19 08:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
CC @ns408

[13-Aug-19 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
internet speed and ping time has very very little to do with the Notary Node's performance. to my opinion, don't fall for that thinking having fastest servers will do any more good than bit slowest servers.

[13-Aug-19 08:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my current situation being done that is I'm out of savings and now cashing out my crypto savings for monthly expenses.

[13-Aug-19 08:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if any of you are using AWS for your Notary Nodes, I'd suggest you to have enough good amount of savings in fiat money already, coz that will save you not cashing out your crypto.

which can help making better protfolio.

[13-Aug-19 08:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I should add that the amount shown is just the billed amount to my bank account. I also paid huge tax for depositing this money to my bank account.

[13-Aug-19 08:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if I estimate that too, that might be close to 30%-35% of tax of my total year's deposited money to bank account.

[13-Aug-19 08:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it kinda wipped all my cash out I did for future savings from last crypto bull market

[13-Aug-19 08:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think I chose good not to stand for 3rd season notary nodes.

[13-Aug-19 08:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still hope to get some profit out of the earned KMD. coz not a single KMD is sold yet from the whole season 2 mined KMD.

yep, mine were SH and AR regions in second season and in season one SH and NA

[13-Aug-19 08:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
first season had second hand own hardware and a OVH server in Canada.

[13-Aug-19 08:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
second, as you can see explained above.

[13-Aug-19 09:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
How much of that 40k ( thats a lot) was for outgoing bandwith?

>my exact words to @ns408 at the start of season 2

Yeah, one of the hardest lessons I have learnt. Cloud infrastructure, mostly automated and yet I'm still unsure how money+time != notarisations + KMD that we expected.

Confirmed by Webmin team now. 1.882 - 1.920 contain RCEs introduced due to compromised build infrastructure. 
1.890 contained the real deal: Remote unauthenticated code execution with default config (commands executed as root).
Compromised builds date back until July *2018...

@miketout @SHossain @kolo  @jl777c I got update from @ns408 that our server was schedule to shut down on 7th August expecting there'll be some update on VRSC updating/hardfork to move to season 3 notarisations sometime around by then ed of July. This schedule was automated to save any further expenses. Seeing my financial situation, I won't be continuing VRSC notarisations further. This is all I could do as much as I could do. Hoping for the best for VRSC and expecting soon they do update their network to count season 3 notarisations. 🙂
