[05-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Warkid#2117
Compiling needs time! How time-critical is this problem?

[05-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Lennart#9331
Oh my god I have to leave now... for work.. hope my KMD is still there when Ii get back home

[05-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Lennart#9331

please read my post carefully

[05-Jun-19 05:54 AM] SHossain#0007
If you have already used Agama in the last 5 months with that seed than its "ok" to use it again to move the funds. We recommend moving all funds (all different coins) out. Use this link to see all your assetchain balance https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php

**How to Generate new address quickly?**
- Use Paper Wallet - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPaperWalletGenerator/archive/master.zip
- Use Verus version of Agama which is not affected -  https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
1. Start VRSC Lite mode
2. create new seed which will generate new address which is compatible with KMD and all assetchain.  **Keed the seed safely backedup** (make a note of that address)

**Alternative method to generate new address**
- Use native mode (best to use CLI) - Safest - Use bootstrap from here if you like https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php
- Use coinbin (may not be most secure as it's web) - https://deckersu.github.io/coinbin/#newAddress

**How to send funds to the new address?**
Send all KMD and assetchains funds to that address, even if Verus wallet doesn't support that coin at the moment. As long as you have the seed safe, you can access your funds later.
0. If you have Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6b, use that to send funds out or
1. Quickest - Agama webwallet ONLY to send funds out immediately https://www.atomicexplorer.com/wallet/#/
2.  You can also use this guide to send all KMD and assetchains to new address. You don't need to use 2 computers. Just use one offline computer https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026631-sign-transactions-offline-and-broadcast-online-using-agama

**Where to send funds?**
- Another address created by Verus Agama or native mode
- Ledger wallet
- CEX (they are not affected but if you want to)

I am trying to clarify.
Any use of any agama in the last 4 months is a risk or only seeds (not priv key wif) made by agama program used in last months.

[05-Jun-19 05:55 AM] PHBA2061#2530
@jeffjam did you use your ledger 24 seeds to log into agama ?

[05-Jun-19 05:55 AM] Alecandro#1179
BE SAFE. MOVE YOUR COINS. GOOD LORD PEOPLE

[05-Jun-19 05:55 AM] Alecandro#1179
it’s not that hard really

[05-Jun-19 05:55 AM] Alecandro#1179
Lol

[05-Jun-19 05:56 AM] Warkid#2117
If my seed was not created by agama???

[05-Jun-19 05:56 AM] Alecandro#1179
Why risk anything at all honestly

[05-Jun-19 05:56 AM] jeffjam#9765
@PHBA2061 No i didnt

[05-Jun-19 05:56 AM] Warkid#2117
Moving is RISK

[05-Jun-19 05:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

If you have a bunch of asset chains in various wallets it’s a long process. I need to know what the story is first.

[05-Jun-19 05:57 AM] LocoMB#8593
yeah the address I used was created Jan.6 2019

[05-Jun-19 05:57 AM] jeffjam#9765
I moved the funds to binance, nothing else functions properly.

[05-Jun-19 05:59 AM] n64#7103
funds are safu -cz

[05-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Warkid#2117
Wil be forked anyway... why moving???

[05-Jun-19 05:59 AM] PHBA2061#2530
if you didn't use your  Ledger 24 seeds  on Agama, then you're safe,

[05-Jun-19 06:01 AM] PHBA2061#2530
the purpose of the incoming fork is to add new notaries nodes

[05-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Thuerlich#0984
@PHBA2061 can i see on veruswallet or can i use my seed to import my wallet from komodo? because i cant send my coins out from komodo agama?

[05-Jun-19 06:02 AM] jeffjam#9765
@PHBA2061 i didnt i just wanted to send funds from agama to my ledger and i cant find any guide how to actually use ledger with agama

[05-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Warkid#2117
So do I understand right... the team is stealing the komodo fron the unsecure adresses and you can get it back by mailing to that guys... please give me my komodo back???

[05-Jun-19 06:04 AM] PHBA2061#2530

@jeffjam Komodo you use with ledger live, ledgers software

[05-Jun-19 06:04 AM] n64#7103
Install the app, create account, get address

[05-Jun-19 06:05 AM] jeffjam#9765
Create account where? Ledger live?

[05-Jun-19 06:06 AM] PHBA2061#2530

[05-Jun-19 06:08 AM] hastrup#8742
Hi I have used my wallet and seed in the past month is it safe for me to send them to a qt wallet?

[05-Jun-19 06:08 AM] mobipoi#5774
Is.this relating to seeds only within five months or if you used agama in general?

[05-Jun-19 06:10 AM] dxer666#8963
verus agama in lite mode have issue?

[05-Jun-19 06:10 AM] dxer666#8963
no problem?

[05-Jun-19 06:11 AM] PHBA2061#2530
please read the pinned message, the short answer is if you input your passphrase in Agama in the last 4 months or so, it is highly recommended to move you funds out to a new generated address (paper wallet)

[05-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Hey.  I just wanted to send my coins to a new address but both are already empty.

[05-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Jimm B. 

Scroll up. 

Likely, your funds are safu.

```
we are sweeping funds from vulnerable addresses to: RSgD2cmm3n.....trEHoHMywJdkbkeF

@Jimm B. a form will be available soon to log missing funds

[05-Jun-19 06:15 AM] n64#7103
@jeffjam download ledger live. login with ledger. install Komodo app. navigate to accounts, create Komodo account. you can then get a Komodo address from ledger and send funds there

[05-Jun-19 06:16 AM] n64#7103
all steps are in the ledger live software

[05-Jun-19 06:17 AM] onebluesky#9439
I just claimed the reward, can I move out of the wallet as soon as there is 1 confirmation? or have to wait for the balance to return?

[05-Jun-19 06:17 AM] n64#7103

[05-Jun-19 06:17 AM] Jimm B.#9993

My agama wallet won’t load, keep getting an error message? “Unknown Method” anyone else having login issues?

[05-Jun-19 06:21 AM] jeffjam#9765
@n64 create a komodo account where? In ledger live?

[05-Jun-19 06:22 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
@OsTa it seemed that it was sent to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF so your funds are safu

[05-Jun-19 06:22 AM] jeffjam#9765
@n64How do you get a kmd address from ledger?

[05-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Warkid#2117
So you just have to send your personal ID copy to the team to get your kmd back?? 😠  How will you manage this, if theseed is ansafe, anybody could say, this is mine!

[05-Jun-19 06:23 AM] onebluesky#9439
oh i see there is a little shield next to it that says it's not dpow secured yet

[05-Jun-19 06:24 AM] PTYX#6840
@Warkid who says you have to send ID?

[05-Jun-19 06:24 AM] PTYX#6840
A simple signature with the old key should be enough no?

[05-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Warkid#2117
How will the owner be identified, if the seed is corrupted????

[05-Jun-19 06:24 AM] PTYX#6840
Right...

[05-Jun-19 06:25 AM] PTYX#6840
Good question. I don't think that means ID though.

[05-Jun-19 06:25 AM] onebluesky#9439
screw it, i'm not going to wait for the transaction to be secured, just getting out of there asap

[05-Jun-19 06:25 AM] lhtc8#6931
Hey guys, Is Agsma wallet offline??? It won’t let me log in???
