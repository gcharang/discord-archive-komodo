[07-Jun-19 01:40 PM] aka222#2811

[07-Jun-19 01:40 PM] aka222#2811
With fix

[07-Jun-19 01:46 PM] Louis#8450
@gcharang - Sorry, was transferring Pirate Coin too, and got confused

[07-Jun-19 01:47 PM] Louis#8450
If your store KMD on Ledger Nano, is that ok?

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis pirate coins are most likely not compromiseed, but I recommend you create a new wallet.dat for it and transfer from old address  to new address from it 
ask for help in the Pirate discord on how to do this

[07-Jun-19 01:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis ledger is ok
make sure you haven't input the ledger seed in old Agama

[07-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Louis#8450
Ok will do - is it ok to check balances on the ledger  Magnum Wallet, as check the balance yesterday for KMD using it?

[07-Jun-19 01:50 PM] Louis#8450
Thanks

[07-Jun-19 02:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@Louis 
>  is it ok to check balances on the ledger  Magnum Wallet,

How it is possible that kmd founder able to move other peoples coins??

[07-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Dom001#1832
logged in with my old seed in the new agama v0.5.6a in VRSC, when i activate kmd, and then got an error:

Connection error!
Trying to switch to another server...

I go into the settings then under SPV servers list and select there one comes out:

Wallet Notification
KMD SPV server electrum1.cipig.net:10001:tcp is unreachable!

Wallet Notification
KMD SPV server electrum2.cipig.net:10001:tcp is unreachable!

i hope my VRSC generated address is compatible with kmd, i filled it into the recover form...

[07-Jun-19 02:42 PM] alen#3721
@mazyar_lp they used the bug in agama wallet, just like a hacker could do it..but they moved them to safe wallet, before bad guys

[07-Jun-19 02:43 PM] alen#3721
Thats how i understood it

okies, thank ya @gcharang

[07-Jun-19 02:47 PM] mazyar_lp#3486
@alen does agama saves all claimed addresses wif or seeds or private keys?? Its annoying to know this. What about decentralisation

[07-Jun-19 02:49 PM] AGL#8368
Luddite here. My agama wallet probably hasn't synced in a year and wondering what the best course of action is. Download new wallet and drag/drop some seed file I assume is in a standard location. Apologies and thanks - A

[07-Jun-19 02:50 PM] gcharang#6833
@AGL you access your wallet using seed?

[07-Jun-19 02:51 PM] AGL#8368
Honestly not sure. Should have the data stored somewhere, but don't have access to that comp at the moment..

[07-Jun-19 02:52 PM] gcharang#6833
you just open agama and the balance is there or you input 24 words?

[07-Jun-19 02:53 PM] AGL#8368
just open...

[07-Jun-19 02:53 PM] AGL#8368
But it became disconnected months ago and I have not viewed it since

[07-Jun-19 02:56 PM] AGL#8368
So when i find my 24 words and plug those into a new wallet I'll be able to see if my funds are safe?

[07-Jun-19 02:58 PM] gcharang#6833
@AGL yes
don't use the old Agama

[07-Jun-19 04:37 PM] gcharang#6833
@super55 both are same, if you click create new wallet in the first one, you go to second

everyone PLEASE READ: users who had assetchain funds swept to the safe address and used a refund address from an exchange since day 1, please DM me with the exact following details: 
```
- The ID you provided on the claim form
- The exchange address you used for your assetchain funds
- The new address that you want to receive your funds to (you must own the private key of this address)
```
Users who ONLY requested a KMD & BTC payout and provided an exchange address don't  DM me for changes.

[07-Jun-19 05:55 PM] Steelrat#2421
And if I filled out the Form allready on day 1?

[07-Jun-19 05:57 PM] SHossain#0007

[07-Jun-19 06:00 PM] IvanV#6413
Hallo how do I know who took my coins you or the hackers  took my KMD?

[07-Jun-19 06:01 PM] gcharang#6833

[07-Jun-19 06:08 PM] jossjana#7067
@SHossain 
Hello, i would like to know
why are some kmd gone and some stayed on agama? why are some kmd gone and some stayed on agama. that is very odd

[07-Jun-19 06:09 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have any funds left at your old address, please move them to your safe address. please read the guide here https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement

[07-Jun-19 06:13 PM] jossjana#7067
Yes, i have some kmd on your safe adress, that you have take out of my adress. And the other kmd in my other wallet, i have save on new wallet. But i dont understand why do you took out my kmd to your safe adress.

[07-Jun-19 06:14 PM] Pwnz#4150
so only for people using "exchange" address @SHossain  ?

[07-Jun-19 06:14 PM] SHossain#0007
Pinned a message.

[07-Jun-19 06:15 PM] angrygnat#7242
is it safe to enter in the old address with the new version of agama?

[07-Jun-19 06:16 PM] SHossain#0007
@Pwnz Please read my post. you shouldn't use exchange address for any other coin except KMD & BTC

[07-Jun-19 06:17 PM] SHossain#0007
@angrygnat if you want to move away funds to safety, yes.

[07-Jun-19 06:17 PM] Pwnz#4150
@SHossain i didn't i'm asking if everyone should DM or only ones that used exchange address in claim 😃

[07-Jun-19 06:18 PM] Pwnz#4150
thank you and sorry if there's any misunderstanding man

[07-Jun-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
`users who had assetchain funds swept to the safe address and used a refund address from an exchange since day 1, please DM me`

[07-Jun-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
only users who had assetchains swept

[07-Jun-19 06:18 PM] SHossain#0007
does that make sense?

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Pwnz#4150
i got that part

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Pwnz#4150
" and used a refund address from an exchange"

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Pwnz#4150
i used a refund address from chameleon pay

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] Pwnz#4150
do i DM you ?

[07-Jun-19 06:19 PM] angrygnat#7242
no, you did it for me, but to receive back my founds i have to use the old address to send an amount on the new one, or not?

[07-Jun-19 06:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Pwnz you're ok as you have the seed from that

[07-Jun-19 06:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
and you'll be able to activate assetchains in verus agama

[07-Jun-19 06:21 PM] Pwnz#4150
yup . thx @mrlynch  ❤

[07-Jun-19 06:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
make sure you backup the seed from chameleon

[07-Jun-19 06:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@jossjana 
if your amount is less than 7777 KMD
it should be by june 15, it could also be sooner

[07-Jun-19 06:27 PM] CryptoJake#9024
@gcharang any potential eta on return?

[07-Jun-19 06:27 PM] jossjana#7067
@gcharang
Ok thanks

[07-Jun-19 06:28 PM] CryptoJake#9024
i received an extremely small amount of KMD to my agama wallet. not sure if what was from staking or if we are to use this for address verification

[07-Jun-19 06:28 PM] CryptoJake#9024
will leave there just in case

[07-Jun-19 06:29 PM] CryptoJake#9024
@gcharang already did and followed the instructions. I believe it did not provide a date, was just curious

[07-Jun-19 06:30 PM] gcharang#6833
> i received an extremely small amount of KMD to my agama wallet. not sure if what was from staking or if we are to use this for address verification
answer to that question

[07-Jun-19 06:30 PM] CryptoJake#9024
ahhh sorry, i read the other article

[07-Jun-19 06:30 PM] CryptoJake#9024
thank you sir

[07-Jun-19 06:31 PM] CryptoJake#9024
guess i was right about it being a verification. i will send it to my new address asap

[07-Jun-19 06:32 PM] CryptoJake#9024
thank you for the extreme effort taken here. it is certainly a nuisance but it is FAR better than losing the coins

@shu-aib with what you have done already, your KMD will be recovered
did you send the small transaction as described here?: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029973-steps-to-reclaim-funds-after-the-agama-incident

[07-Jun-19 06:38 PM] jossjana#7067

[07-Jun-19 06:38 PM] CryptoJake#9024
@jossjana send to your new address

[07-Jun-19 06:39 PM] crachel723#7547
is there a way to know if your funds were sent to the safe address? As of now I have a zero balance. But how do we check if our funds were swept?

[07-Jun-19 06:39 PM] shu-aib#3474
@gcharang yes, I sent it to my Coinomi wallet which was the address submitted in the form

[07-Jun-19 06:40 PM] CryptoJake#9024
@crachel723 was it sent to RSgD2cmm3niFRu2kwwtrEHoHMywJdkbkeF ?

[07-Jun-19 06:40 PM] crachel723#7547
how do I know if it was?
