Question for the infographic contest: when i want to improve my proposal, should i delete and reupload the images in my original post? Or just attach the improved version in the comments thread?

[24-Sep-18 09:22 AM] benohanlon#1119
@LakshmiNaveen you can certainly participate. Create your own post on reddit and use the 'infographic contest' flair, then go to the master post that is stickied and link to your post. And let me know too and I'll include it in our master twitter thread here https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1043563944227622912.

[24-Sep-18 09:22 AM] benohanlon#1119
@Lennart you should attach the improved version so we can see the improvements you've made.

@benohanlon Do you have 3-4 links for people to share when submitting their request to coinbase?    We want to be thorough and enticing enough across all of the submissions to make them take noticee.

[25-Sep-18 10:49 PM] benohanlon#1119
@FishyGuts what links do we need? There's a lot of info on the infographic post on reddit or in the five bullet Fridays on medium.

[25-Sep-18 11:06 PM] Steve Lee#1967
@FishyGuts Let's hold off and let the team first consolidate answers first so we can distribute and maintain consistency in our answers across multiple submissions.

[25-Sep-18 11:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
"let the team first consolidate answers first so we can distribute and maintain consistency in our answers across multiple submissions." 

This is what I was wondering or looking for.   Would be good for people to have a format to share.   This is big business... this isn't a listing on a new unheard of exchange 😃

[25-Sep-18 11:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Steve Lee understands what I was trying to get to.
Like,   Would you prefer one infographic to be shared?   All of them?   
Any blurbs about WHY they should add that people can copy paste?    
Make sure someone goes through the app first and can detail the response meticulously.

[25-Sep-18 11:09 PM] Steve Lee#1967

[25-Sep-18 11:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So when coinbase sees it they see somehting that is fluent and homogenous across the board instead of a bunch of fanbois asking LIST XRP #thestandard

Hello mods, I was looking at the Reddit post concerning the submissions and feedback. I noticed a type, I think, since I was looking into the recommended fonts. Here's the post: 
```Recommended fonts: Monseratt, Roboto, Open Sans, Helvetica, or Arial```


Is that Montseratt with the missing'T' or are we talking about a different font?
I know it seems trivial, but I don't want to miss a single thing.
Thank you.

[26-Sep-18 12:23 AM] Steve Lee#1967
We meant Montseratt. Thanks for pointing it out, we'll correct this on the master post

[26-Sep-18 12:32 AM] benohanlon#1119

@benohanlon Hey, me again! Don't mean to be picky or annoying, but I was looking at the color palette and noticed there was some colors that are new and pretty much unseen on the main website. I'm probably just looking for reassurance here, but before implementing them on my infographic, I wanted to make sure that these were accurate and possibly being used for the "rebrand", so to speak. Here's the link I'm referring to: https://i.redd.it/7w49eqqt9fo11.png

Thank you.

@Steve Lee those look like some of your colors. Can you comment?

[26-Sep-18 02:21 AM] benohanlon#1119
The colour palette is an interim set. @Steve Lee put them together himself so I'm confident they're correct @MoldyLunchbox. It's always good to check though 🙏🏻

[26-Sep-18 02:23 AM] Regnar#6164
@benohanlon do we have a page set up to show all the projects that are currently using dPoW?

[26-Sep-18 02:45 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
@benohanlon Thanks, Benohanlon!

[26-Sep-18 03:03 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Alright, more questions! I'm trying to color the logo (the octogon) but we don't have a reference for the new logo using the new color palette. I know you guys want to distance yourself from the yellow and orange, so I'm guessing they'll be dropped. Are you looking to have the infographic contestants try to implement the new color palette into the logo's original shape, or do you guys have one already made with the new color scheme?

Thanks for the info!

[26-Sep-18 03:17 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
More precisely, I'm talking about how your old logo has very matching and appropriate color schemes. With the new ones, we're looking at something like this: https://imgur.com/a/IpN0BKn

I'm sure you guys already have an idea of which color goes where, and that would help tremendously as it would eliminate the guess work. Thank you.
