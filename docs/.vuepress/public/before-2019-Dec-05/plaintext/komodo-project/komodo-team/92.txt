Do anybody help me to build smart chain from scratch. After all compiled not get komodod file.

[07-Sep-19 04:22 PM] Audo#5667
Hello @pandaanu73 , you can use Antara Composer app to spin up a new chain: https://composer.kmd.io/

Alternatively you can contact a service provider and work with them.

All issues aside, I want to say that the Komodo Team is doing what is most important, and that is delivering the tech to it's users, such as myself. I think that the Komodo team should hear that, more than anything else. 

Issues come and go, and get worked out.
The Community, it'll always be here. 
AtomicDEX, is so great.

Is there a guideline for changing an ERC20 token to the Komodo chain? Effort, costs, advantages, supporting assistants etc?

[13-Sep-19 08:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@AronXuanGoldberg#3393   You can forward them to partners@komodoplatform.com or one of our service providers to see what kind of migration they are looking for .  Biggest advantage for switching over is not being restrained by Eth gas and lower costs if they wish to do future integrations .

[13-Sep-19 08:41 PM] kandru#4047
Hi Komodo-team

[13-Sep-19 08:42 PM] Aron“XuanLeeeeee“Goldberg#3393
@polycryptoblog Generally it would be good from my point of view to have a rough description, a kind of manual with the necessary steps as well as the advantages.

How to switch manually:
Go to "Settings", select "SPV Server List" tab, choose new server and click "OK".

Possibly even a short presentation (video) as available for Atomic swaps from Komodo

[13-Sep-19 08:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Typically a snapshot and airdrop of the new coin needs done , some wish to remove from circulation the old Eth which is another step .   Lowest cost is free as they can do this by themselves if they need ,  otherwise cost is dependent on the service provider and the man-hours needed.  Benefits : no gas fees,  reduced cost for other Komodo integrations like DPoW and Atomicdex listing ,  CC development

[13-Sep-19 08:47 PM] ca333#0118
@kandru which agama wallet version are you using? Have you tried using atomicDEX mobile to access/move your coins?

[13-Sep-19 08:48 PM] kandru#4047
@ca333  I'm using V0.2.41-beta

@polycryptoblog Thanks for the listing. This packaged in an attractive brochure/report with a visual illustration would be very interesting. So the first hurdle would be cleared for projects that want to leave ETH.

Im thinking KMD ecosystem could buy DP for like 30k $ probably to have a working CEX, then delete scam coins -> rebrand -> get listed on CMC
so for about 3 BTC (amount for listing on many exchanges) some other things could be possible (getting all KMD coin on this CEX -> rebranding -> listing all on CMC)

is dp looking to sell?

[17-Sep-19 08:41 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
idk if they are looking to sell but they do not look like developing [business] imo 😛

[17-Sep-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
DP outsources all their IT and pays dearly for it, making it hard for them to make money. If KMD bought it, and used all our in-house skills, it might just be a profitable venture. Just sayin'

[17-Sep-19 02:20 PM] joe2x4#5987
Fascinating idea.

[17-Sep-19 02:22 PM] joe2x4#5987
Maybe DEX profits could buy the CEX.

[17-Sep-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What if maybe, and I'm just spit-balling here, someone were to actually ask if they were even willing to sell before this became a topic? 🤔

Still. DEX buys CEX. There is some sort of irony to it. Unsure if genius or madness

zaddex is an ecosystem exchange

[17-Sep-19 02:33 PM] jorian#4555
zaddex is quite dead

[17-Sep-19 02:34 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so buying DP will not make it dead?

[17-Sep-19 02:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`zaddex is quite dead`

You can't make dead that which already is 🤷🏽

attracting users is one of the hardest things

[17-Sep-19 02:36 PM] jorian#4555
we as a komodo ecosystem should actually all move from DP to zaddex

[17-Sep-19 02:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`the devil you know...`

[17-Sep-19 02:38 PM] jorian#4555
oh wait, zaddex only has like 8 coins

[17-Sep-19 02:38 PM] jorian#4555
one of which is OUR

[17-Sep-19 02:38 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
rephrase, so buying DP will not make it deaded?

[17-Sep-19 02:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the only thing I can say for sure is that DP supported ARRR back when I was convinced that zaddex would never even exist 🤷🏽

[17-Sep-19 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the flip-side of that is:
with the current structure split, does anyone even know who owns the IP rights for DP?

[17-Sep-19 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some divorces are very messy
