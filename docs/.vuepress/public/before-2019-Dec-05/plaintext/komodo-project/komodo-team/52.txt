Jackson Palmer is asking questions about dPoW on twitter

[07-Oct-18 08:41 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
like has any blockchain using dPoW suffered an attempt at 51% attack that was so avoided?

I think maybe channels CC is closer to satoshi's vision as it doesnt have the disadvantages of LN

Somebody will be live-streaming a 51% attack on the cryptocurrency "Einsteinium" on October 13. This should be interesting to watch. https://t.co/u1Pi7TQ2dl

Nothing@Stake is a big issue in #blockchain space, and many projects out there are trying to solve this problem. @VerusCoin came with a solution to it using @KomodoPlatform's #CryptoConditions tech. https://t.co/AUW2sfG2SJ

Andreas seems to care only about lightning network. Thats what he thinks will solve all the bottlenecks, and thus, is the only thing worth talking about innovation wise.

[09-Oct-18 01:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
I am a fan of his work, and his outlook on things

[09-Oct-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
He lacks the updates on the topics he says is not solved.
If he is not up-to-date on the subject that if anyone has solved it, his opinion on it doesn't mean that it's not solved.
I prefer to see the solution working in practice than just listening to his opinion.

He's a great speaker and influencer for Bitcoin community, and I respect his ways of dealing with cryptocurrency crowd.
But I don't like his way of discarding the fact without being assured if he's up to date on the subject and commenting it's not done/solved yet.

i noticed couple of typos in the latest tech tuesday. in the paragraph:
Tertiary Partnership – University of Texas Arlington

This week we announced a partnership with the UoT computer science and engineering faculty. Komodo is committed to providing engineering solutions and this partnership further cements the commitment of the team in achieving technology backed by high levels of sound maths and engineering *****principals*****-> principles – already recognised by China’s ministry of industry and information technology.

there are three I can picture in my mind right now that are not block of texts (I think 25, 18 and 12)

[10-Oct-18 02:25 PM] benohanlon#1119
ultimately it's not my decision... we've picked the finalists and the community will vote on the final 5

[10-Oct-18 02:25 PM] benohanlon#1119
we've also got 3 honourable mentions

[10-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Meyse#0952

there's a recording on reddit in the main sticky post where we give feedback - you may find that insighful

[10-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Meyse#0952
i dont really understand the value in that. to me it would be obvious to try to onboard as many developers as possible (push them away from the ethereum is best bias) and to grow the ecosystem
