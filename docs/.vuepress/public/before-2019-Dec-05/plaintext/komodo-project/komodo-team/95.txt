Do you need the commands, or a framework for a specific language?

Commands list:

On the left side menu choose `Smart Chain Essentials ` then `Smart Chain API ` then the relevant category you are looking for.

What's the difference between getnewaddress and z_getnewaddress

[28-Sep-19 07:29 AM] Oszy#5734
First gives you transparent address, second gives you Z-Address, only works on chains where Z transactions are enabled.

[28-Sep-19 07:35 AM] lc123456#5516
common address has "listtransactions  "

[28-Sep-19 07:36 AM] lc123456#5516

Hey, we got a question about how long the bans last. Technically bans are permanent and we have to manually unban people. We are not too eager to unban the banned without being sure that they really want to come back to our community.

The solution is a form they can fill and make an appeal. If they do that and promise to behave we are happy to unban them.

The form: https://forms.monday.com/forms/5fd66a8253ca0111449a26807c88a113

[07-Oct-19 02:44 PM] Audo#5667
hey @joe2x4 & @siu - Chainmakers we can continue the pricing discussion here.

The pricing we have is like a discovery pricing. We might tweak it in the future.

For dPoW we have used the concept of grandfathering of pricing concept where we keep charging the same amount that the project signed-up with. Thus even if we raise the price later it doesn't affect the current projects who operate with certain price tag in mind.

[07-Oct-19 02:45 PM] joe2x4#5987
```there is some bashing going on to kmd because there is a fee for using antara network gui and atomicdex gui listing.```
 
 this is interesting. I'm curious to know where the current pricing came from. The people complaining probably won't bite even if the price is $6500 or $4500. Probably not even at $1000. These people are just not interested at any price. For those truly interested you could probably raise the price to $10,000-$20,000 and still get just as many bites. (Has anyone done a focus group on the pricing?) The weird thing about pricing and perceived value is if you price to low, people perceive low quality. I'd price Antara at $100,000 just like a CEX listing. Those that can pay, you want, those that can't, probably won't at any price anyway. But the perceived value is alot more serious then a good bargain. We don't want to be seen as needing to beg people to buy.
 You can also always lower prices through sales, discounts, grants, student discounts, scholarship, etc. Encourage people to run through the tutorial to get a discount or do x for discount. Or offer one month a year for a sale etc. What do the sales and marketing people have to say about this? @siu - Chainmakers

You can always fork them and add whatever you want 🤷🏽

I'm curious to hear where this bashing took place and what the arguments were.

[07-Oct-19 02:50 PM] joe2x4#5987
Here is a question, why do some CEX charge so much?

[07-Oct-19 02:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
because people pay it
If no one ever paid $750k for a listing then no exchange would charge that much

[07-Oct-19 02:53 PM] Audo#5667
and I want to stress that

our atomic swap protocol & P2P orderbooks = decentralized open source technology without any listing pricing
AtomicDEX = a reference product build on top of this technology that is currently at least partly a propreatiery product that charges a listing fee (part of our business model)

[07-Oct-19 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
👆🏽 hence why I said you can fork it; the "listing" fee is from the GUI maker, not the actual network

Or simply raise prices and no need to educate as product is instantly better or the best. Prices can always come down.

Many years ago, one of our clients, (we were their IT), was the highest priced plumbing service in the Denver area. The owner laid out this exact advise. He was VERY successful despite much cheaper options for plumbing. People wanted the best and perceived high price as "the best". I don't go to Walmart for the best.

[07-Oct-19 05:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

Nice summary:  GUI maker charges a fee.
1.  The initial research to integrate a GUI
2. The initial designs of the GUI
3. The ongoing maintenance of the GUI
4. The ongoing maintenance of the coins on the network used in the GUI
5. Also I think there are a couple of servers chucked in for keeping a running marketmaker for the coin.

(5) Itself is worth the fee alone in some industries

[07-Oct-19 11:15 PM] phm87#7395
So if someone adds a coin into atomicdex code without the GUI part, then make an ugly GUI (or fork hyperdex to add the coin), is it bad or good ? I understood that there is no 7500$ fee (but no infra and the coin won't be on the official GUI of atomicdex). In my imagination, a fee will be paid but on each trade.

[07-Oct-19 11:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`is it bad or good ?`
that depends on the users' perspective

[07-Oct-19 11:38 PM] phm87#7395
I have still few dollars worth of random shitcoins that get delisted of everywhere ... maybe atomicdex is the solution to let their exchange rate reach 0 slowly (it can't be worst than scammy CEX with weak security and central delisting/listing decisions and different prices)

[07-Oct-19 11:39 PM] actionslacks#4072

in BarterDEX-GUI, the last important task I did was to automate the new coin additions to the GUI from the github repo directly.

[08-Oct-19 12:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The logic is not too tough

[08-Oct-19 12:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
all the coins in jl777/coins repo showed in the GUI, and this list get updated everytime the GUI started.

[08-Oct-19 12:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with latest mm2 based GUIs the same logic can also be put in place by new GUIs.

[08-Oct-19 08:41 AM] willofleo#7505
"the Walmart would be forking HyperDEX and adding the entire coins repo to it and charging little or nothing" I also agree with one of the statement of making it back on the fees , in addition microcap coins can have an exchange,  @grewalsatinder  talked about coin addition automation I believe it the way forward and could include in addition fee to the gui as well maybe 500$ and once it reached whole community can  start trading

[08-Oct-19 08:41 AM] willofleo#7505
profit can be made aback over time , assuming in the future there would be 100,000 more coins created or a 1 million per year , ( that 500,000,000 in rev)

[08-Oct-19 08:46 AM] willofleo#7505
add to the assumption that antara will make it very easy for individuals to create their own coins , my only con about the charging fee is that which comes first, the coins or the volume , in all successful exchanges (although some failed after)  listed a-lot of coins for free and as they gained (or faked)volume started charging to gain access to the volume , so I think it volume first fees later , not the other way round to create a profitable GUI

[08-Oct-19 11:09 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
If we ask for $2k for all of the 250 or so coins that can be added we would make a wooping $500k

[08-Oct-19 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
That is enough to maintain the exchange for 2 or 3 years.

[08-Oct-19 11:10 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
We also thought on adding a small gui fee on top of the dex fee... But then it may scare users away.

[08-Oct-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If anyone thinks that it is easy or cheap to hire good devs to build out a GUI, they are kidding themselves.

[08-Oct-19 11:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I don't really like people using hyperDEX as a example of something free and kinda working as a argument for not paying a listing fee. It was not free, the bill was just footed by someone else. I cannot fault others from recouping some development costs to implement your project.

[08-Oct-19 11:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Realistically it would be hard to make back all the sunk costs of a GUI development with trading fees alone. You need to have trading volumes in the millions DAILY to make anything and 10s of millions to support more than 1-2 devs.
