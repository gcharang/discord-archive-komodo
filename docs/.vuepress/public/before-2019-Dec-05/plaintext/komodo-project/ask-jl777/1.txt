Is this space reserved for technical questions only, or can questions of any level be brought here to you about the kmdplatform?

When moon?

[13-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Ludom#5832
Sorry, when mars?

Not sure where to ask this 
are the holdings ZCASH and DECRED in SN Nav written off or just not accessible for the moment.

[13-Jun-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[13-Jun-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes they are written off or not accessible?

[13-Jun-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
both

[13-Jun-18 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
written off as they are not accessible now

[13-Jun-18 04:24 PM] Mark81#4505
why those are not accessible?

[13-Jun-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
stuck in poloniex and bittrex

[13-Jun-18 09:20 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
is there a way to retrieve them? Like giving access to a trusted team member that can get verified?

[14-Jun-18 12:39 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You would have a multi million dollar withdrawal on your identity :/ how do you explain that. Lol

[14-Jun-18 12:40 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If it isn't multi million anymore it's still easily 100k+

[14-Jun-18 04:48 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
Just say , invested early, and it should be fine and don't withdraw to a country with high tax, because a lot of questions and paperworks. I plan to check out Singapore next year. I heard it doesn't tax long term crypto holding.

[14-Jun-18 05:18 AM] PTYX#6840
Hmmm

[14-Jun-18 05:18 AM] PTYX#6840
There has to be a solution

[14-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@BlackJesus  you can have someone that lives in a tax friendly country do it

[14-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
let them sign a contract beforehand

[14-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
pay a small fee to them for the effort

[14-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or cover possible taxes

[14-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and at least recover part of it

[14-Jun-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, progress (very slow) is being made

I'm really sorry to ask this question in this channel but I really need to have the JL's reflexion about this. My question is : How do you deal with the idea that those who benefited the most of an illegitimate system of money are the one that will be able to buy the largest parts of the currency you create ?

[14-Jun-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
they could have but at least the playing field is a bit more level than it used to be. the more crypto market becomes the more level. You cant fix things in an instant, it will take decades and we are off to a good start

[14-Jun-18 06:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
"If a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized and purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security, Hinman added. "      This makes the landscape much more navigable .

[14-Jun-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
having the ecosystem of many independent companies/projects working on KMD certainly helps us get more and more decentralized, not just from a nodes standpoint but from an overall ecosystem point. Also, in some sense each notary node is an independent business contributing to KMD ecosystem, contrary to some uninformed critics who call notaries some centralized entity since they all have the same function. this would be like saying all miners are a single centralized entity as they are all doing this "mining" thing

[14-Jun-18 07:01 PM] lard-on#2754

[14-Jun-18 07:17 PM] jl777c#5810
before crypto, you had to be rich already to make any meaningful amounts of money. crypto has changed this. of course money can still be used to make money, but so can knowledge and hard work. That alone is a big win and if half the value of crypto is still in hands of the non-establishement that is hundreds of billions created for those who previously were locked out of such gains. There is no need for total domination for there to be victory and a decntralization of money making

[14-Jun-18 07:28 PM] lard-on#2754
that's a good start. Yeah let's say it's a first step toward the end of extreme accaparation of the earth's weath by the few. But not the ultimate answer

[14-Jun-18 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the path to the ultimate answer must start with the first step and we have already made many steps. Some small country will make a national crypto that can be atomic swapped with the existing cryptos. As soon as that happens there will be a decentralized pathway into and out of fiat world

[14-Jun-18 07:45 PM] jl777c#5810
dozens of countries are investigating making a national crypto, but there isnt any actual crypto tech that works to support even a small country. KMD is likely the closest to solving this as the security aspect is also solved, which most  (all?) the other scaling solutions tradeoff in order to achieve the scaling. But scaling without security is just a disaster waiting to happen

[14-Jun-18 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
all the sharding solutions appears to also fragment the mining power across the shards, which weakens the security proportionally

[14-Jun-18 07:55 PM] lard-on#2754
I understand that and I'm so enthousiast about country being able to free themself on a financial point. (I know too well how the IMF works, especially with  "third world"). But I find the climate/migration/energy crises rises so fast that I don't know if we actually have time to build alternative before it all colapse.

[14-Jun-18 08:19 PM] jl777c#5810
there is time. things are progressing ahead of schedule. the fact that the establishment are at least partially vested in crypto now, the seeds are planted and it is a matter of time

[14-Jun-18 08:43 PM] lard-on#2754
I hope you're right (you spend so much time working on it even tho you don't financially need it, I'm pretty confident you know what you're doing)

[14-Jun-18 08:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I am just one person, but now there are dozens (maybe even 100+ now) working just in the KMD ecosystem, not to mention the thousands across the entire  crypto space.  Most projects have at least some decentralization spirit, certainly compared to the banksters

@jl777c  Marshall Islands has proudly declared that they have a sovereign cryptocurrency.

Have you looked into adding them to the DEX?

If so, they would be a great fit, because Marshall Islands are a territory of the United States, and the US government is ashamed of how they tested nuclear bombs in their territories. 

It's unlikely the US would have public support in stopping the marshall islands from being the first sovereign atomic swappable currency.

Would be a great way in and out of USD, too.

[15-Jun-18 03:14 PM] elPataDeLana#9387
@noashh  can we bridge this to Matrix?

[15-Jun-18 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure about the technical details of the marshall islands coin

[15-Jun-18 07:09 PM] Ludom#5832
Notary nodes are working for the ecosystem

[15-Jun-18 07:09 PM] Ludom#5832
It's not always visible

[15-Jun-18 07:09 PM] Ludom#5832
But as I know they are making great work

[15-Jun-18 07:10 PM] Ludom#5832
We are ambassadors of Komodo

[15-Jun-18 07:11 PM] Ludom#5832
@jl777 You made the possibility to make delayed Proof of Stake right?

[15-Jun-18 07:13 PM] Ludom#5832
What is the consensus model? Based on Nxt consensus ("transparent forging") or something more like peercoin ?

[15-Jun-18 07:13 PM] Ludom#5832
Sorry for my old references

[15-Jun-18 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is original, nothing at all like PoS

[15-Jun-18 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a PoS mode for assetchains that is not so different than peercoin

[15-Jun-18 07:35 PM] Ludom#5832
Ok

[15-Jun-18 07:35 PM] Ludom#5832
That was my question

[15-Jun-18 07:35 PM] Ludom#5832
It's peercoin with always the possibility to mine or only staking ?

[15-Jun-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
not fo rKMD, but for assetchains with -ac_staked=<perc> where the perc is 1 to 100, setting the percentage of PoS blocks

[15-Jun-18 07:36 PM] Ludom#5832
The staking participate to the securisation or is it just "for the pleasure"?

[15-Jun-18 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is different from peercoin

[15-Jun-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
for the assetchains, it is the consensus mechanism to create new blocks

[15-Jun-18 07:37 PM] Ludom#5832
Ok

[15-Jun-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but most of teh security would come from dPoW

[15-Jun-18 07:37 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes I know

[15-Jun-18 07:38 PM] Ludom#5832
But dPoW is not the single mecanism to secure the chain

[15-Jun-18 07:38 PM] Ludom#5832
Because I possibly can propose a PoS system for a project

[15-Jun-18 07:39 PM] Ludom#5832
But I think it's better to propose something with notarisation as dPoW

[15-Jun-18 07:39 PM] Ludom#5832
PoS is interesting because it's an easy consensus to explain

[15-Jun-18 07:40 PM] Ludom#5832
It's a nice solution for "federeted organisation".

[15-Jun-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
well easy explaining is not the best way to decide on the consensus mechanism

[15-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Ludom#5832
Right

[15-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Ludom#5832
But sometime explaining/understanding is good for adoption

[15-Jun-18 07:42 PM] Ludom#5832
And PoS give interesting scale of weight on a system

[15-Jun-18 07:42 PM] Ludom#5832
In federeted organisations

[15-Jun-18 07:43 PM] Ludom#5832
Consensus and mechanism is a question of politic too

[15-Jun-18 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is why for assetchains made it so you can set 0 to 100% PoS to PoW ratio

[15-Jun-18 07:43 PM] Ludom#5832
It's great

[15-Jun-18 07:44 PM] Ludom#5832
If you have a 100% PoS ratio, do you need the Komodo notaries?

[15-Jun-18 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization  is always optional

[15-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Ludom#5832
Is it easy to launch such a chain?

[15-Jun-18 07:46 PM] Ludom#5832
Because the project about I speak could make their own notary nodes

[15-Jun-18 07:47 PM] Ludom#5832
And it's a goal to be independant and PoS could be a good way to organize this new network

[15-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Ludom#5832
It's just the first steps of reflexion

[15-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Ludom#5832
We are in competition with sytems like Ethereum

[15-Jun-18 07:49 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_name=POSCHAIN -ac_staked=100 -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=1000000

[15-Jun-18 07:49 PM] Ludom#5832
Ethereum sucks I know

[15-Jun-18 07:50 PM] Ludom#5832
But the decisions are not taken just about rational arguments

[15-Jun-18 07:51 PM] Ludom#5832
Is it possible to set up  assetchain without anonymity?

[15-Jun-18 07:52 PM] Ludom#5832
I think yes but it's native to the assetchains right?

[15-Jun-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
you could just not use it

[15-Jun-18 07:52 PM] jl777c#5810
to disable it would require code changes

[15-Jun-18 07:53 PM] Ludom#5832
PoS could be good without the possibility to mix the token (except with atomic swap)

[15-Jun-18 07:55 PM] Ludom#5832
If I speak about that it's because I'm privileged advisor for local crypto-projects with university and politics

[15-Jun-18 07:56 PM] Ludom#5832
And I want to propose some Komodo related solutions

[15-Jun-18 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[15-Jun-18 07:57 PM] Ludom#5832
And politics are difficult to convince because they fear the fails

[15-Jun-18 07:57 PM] Ludom#5832
And full anonymity is not very popular

[15-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Ludom#5832
Specificaly if you want to propose solutions used by the state services

[15-Jun-18 07:58 PM] Ludom#5832
pseudonymity like Bitcoin is more appreciated

[15-Jun-18 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
for a nation state we can make customizations
