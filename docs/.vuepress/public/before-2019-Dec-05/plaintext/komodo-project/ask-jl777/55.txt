I implemented webMethods, Tibco and Staffware at ING, Rabo, ABN-AMRO, Fortis, SNS; DNB and Equens were moving to "XML" and publish-request-reply systems; even did some for Danish and German banks too. The horrors I've seen.

(with XML I mean bastardized SOAP-like messages that could deal with the X.25/X.27 networks)

Yes the mind map I've made to get a grasp of the evolution of supernet>komodo, I need to update it with latest projects and techs 😃 Happy to ear that its findable haha. Thank for posting it Jl 👌

[23-Mar-19 01:27 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Question: Will the Komodo DEX add value to the KMD token? Will the KMD token be used for the transaction fees?

[23-Mar-19 01:37 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Tx fess will be paid in the native coin traded. Making people use komodo to use the dex isnt how it works. That model is reatrictive and only exists to enrich the host token holders. People will find an alternative. Komodo vision is not to be restrictive but enable all to use the tech without needing komodo. Komodo usage on the dex could take preference due to its security and fast tx times.

[23-Mar-19 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
side note: there is no "KMD token" or "DEX token"

[23-Mar-19 01:38 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Dex token will get some of the fees paid using the dex.

[23-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
DEX dividends are paid out in kmd iirc, so when a dividend is paid, fees in other crypto will need to be converted into kmd

[23-Mar-19 01:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That could increase the value i suspose

[23-Mar-19 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep, more buying to support price I guess

[23-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, a lot of coins will be offered with a kmd base pair because this is what the kmd community prefers, also increasing kmd awareness

[23-Mar-19 01:46 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I still cant grasp what is making KMD valuable now and in the future (although i hold KMD now b/c its a cool project). I want to understand why and how the KMD project and the KMD token can be valuable now and in the future. Why does the world need that token (why not use a other token for all purposes like with the DEX project?)

[23-Mar-19 01:48 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Like i can buy 1 KMD now for about a dollar. What can i do with it now besides holding or selling it? And why would i need 1 KMD in 10 years, what can i do with that then?

[23-Mar-19 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
1) KMD is a currency, not a "token" there's a distinct difference
2) the value is just like the value of anything, demand

[23-Mar-19 01:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You could ask that question with any project right now tbh

[23-Mar-19 01:50 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
The less restrictive platforms will be the most adopted imo

[23-Mar-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Like i can buy 1 KMD now for about a dollar. What can i do with it now besides holding or selling it?`
Exchange for value, just like any other currency

[23-Mar-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
What can you do with your native fiat?

[23-Mar-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the answer is the same

[23-Mar-19 01:52 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`And why would i need 1 KMD in 10 years, what can i do with that then?`
'And why would i need 1 USD in 10 years, what can i do with that then?'

[23-Mar-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
Many of the assetchains have KMD as their base pair for trading. All coins dpowing to KMD need KMD to notarize to it. Later this year KMD itself will have a myriad of cryptoconditions

[23-Mar-19 01:53 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@CryptoNinjaa  i know that, but KMD is my main holding so i ask it here :). Of course i invested money into it to make profit (in dollars or in services in the future).  So if KMD is a currency, me investing in it would mean i think that KMD will be adopted in the future (which means high demand and with the fixed supply of 200M a higher price?)

[23-Mar-19 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`me investing in it would mean i think that KMD will be adopted in the future`
literally the only real reason to invest in any crypto

[23-Mar-19 01:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Exactly . The more built on komodo means more usage for komodo. And dont forget ur earning 5.1% an year with komodo

[23-Mar-19 01:54 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Well i dont do that yet, have them all on Binance still but i know about that possibility.

[23-Mar-19 01:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
As more services come online the more connected the projects become. Offering different services to kmd

[23-Mar-19 01:55 PM] Alright#0419
You have an IOU from binance, not KMD

[23-Mar-19 01:56 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If you invest in any crypto without anticipating adoption, then your goal of that investment is to be atop the pyramid when it collapses (because that's your only hope: that you can sell it so someone you think is a sucker for more than you paid for it).

[23-Mar-19 01:57 PM] CoinKing88#1540
All right, thanks guys.

[23-Mar-19 02:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

[23-Mar-19 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
you also need kmd for notarizations etc

[23-Mar-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
I claim that the bigger the komodo ecosystem, the better for KMD. Not 1:1, but even 1% to 10% spillover and it will be quite significant. Think about thousands of blockchain projects and the size of the ecosystem, with 1% to 10% spilling over into KMD. Especially as it will be the path of least resistance (most liquidity) for many projects. Also if mm2 does as well as some people say, the KMD buying pressure will be quite big. $1 mil of revshares means 1 million KMD needs to be purchased, that is starting to get into "moving the market" territory

[23-Mar-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
dont underestimate the value of goodwill. this is a concept from the real world where even though it doesnt appear in any direct transaction, it still has a lot of value.

[23-Mar-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
If you are looking at the short or medium term, maybe these effects are not relevant. I look at the very long term and have tried to optimize the results over that timeframe. There are things in the code dealing with things 10 and 20 years from now

[23-Mar-19 02:54 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Thanks for replying! I am starting to get a grasp. One more thing, do you see crypto taking over as a standard for transactions instead of fiat currency?

This reminds me of Bitcoin and think, why Bitcoin is set for too long period for last of it's bits to mine in 2100+? 🤔

[23-Mar-19 03:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
because of the 10 min block time or something other reason behind it too?

[23-Mar-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
think about the phone system. do people still use landlines? how many years since cellphones appeared?

[23-Mar-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
@CoinKing88 another "off balance sheet" benefit for KMD as new projects (sectors) start adopting it, is that the ones creating the solutions to get this adoption will likely have KMD that they are incentivized to have increase in value. So, maybe in subtle ways KMD is made part of the solution. No contracts to require this, no obligation, but the natural tendency when you are vested in something is to help out where you can.

[23-Mar-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
Imagine thousands of such projects

[23-Mar-19 03:19 PM] CoinKing88#1540
you got me at off balance sheet as i am in accounting 😀 👌

[23-Mar-19 03:26 PM] CoinKing88#1540
Speaking of that, do you guys publish a financial year report (i assume there is a Komodo company behind the coin)? Or a simple balance sheet?

[23-Mar-19 03:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
@CoinKing88 this isnt a financial report but it highlights the achievements made in 2018 - https://komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Komodos-2018-Year-End-Report.pdf

[23-Mar-19 03:34 PM] CoinKing88#1540
I found that one. In general it is pretty amazing that almost no financials are published while people are investing billions in this market. 2019 will be the year ICO-money is going to run out for some project (if that didn't happen already without the market knowing it). Like EOS, they collected 3.2 billion USD. Yet nobody seems to care what they do with it and how much is left (and in what form, EOS-tokens, ETH, BTC or fiat).

[23-Mar-19 08:39 PM] jspook16#3059
So is KMD planning to post financials in the future. Perhaps kmd financials along with any ac coins that also want to participate all in one report. Maybe that's a fit for @CoinKing88

[23-Mar-19 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
I am on the open source project side of things and as such it is not any corporation, so not sure that financials makes any sense when there are no products being sold. the various revshares are all visible on the blockchain.
as far as the "corporate" side of things, maybe they will decide to publish financials after all the corp structure is in place, but as I said I am not directly involved in that side of things. I guess if to use the linux model, I am the linus on the open source side and there are companies like redhat for the commerial operations. [not claiming that I am anywhere near linus, just explaining the rough separation of things]

When people hear abt ARRR PirateChain for the first time, some say .. ah, thats a Komodo fork.. i wonder if ARRR can ever shake this.. as people might not know what KMD is or what the advantages of Komodo arrrr .. but for people like me Komodo is not interesting because i am into piracy coins, aehm privacy coins i mean..  So would you rather define ARRR as a Zcash or a Komodo fork or a merger technically speaking? .. not much of a techie myself but am very happy with ARRR .. thx jl

[27-Mar-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`some say .. ah, thats a Komodo fork.. i wonder if ARRR can ever shake this.. `
Well, the short answer is that requires the long answer of people understanding what an assetchain actually is as well as what "forced privacy" is/means

Hi. Do you heard about WebAssembly (WASM) ? It's a open standard developped by the W3C that allow C programs to run on the browser at nearly native speed. It is still recent but we can imagine the future: AAA games on the browser, 3D virtual reality on website, online full-scale Photoshop-like application, etc... Do you think this is something that the crypto ecosystem can beneficit from ?
