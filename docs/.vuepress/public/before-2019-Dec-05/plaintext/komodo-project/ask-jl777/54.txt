[18-Mar-19 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
###
In 1976, Knuth prepared a second edition of Volume 2, requiring it to be typeset again, but the style of type used in the first edition (called hot type) was no longer available. In 1977, he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable. Eight years later, he returned with TEX, which is currently used for all volumes.

C++ has nice things like vectors and stuff... just code in C and use the C++ easy parts when required. Seemes to work for me.

[23-Mar-19 08:50 AM] Monetashi#8770
Another fundamental question in my mind is, what is considered object oriented programming. In my opinion, C++/JAVA has not much to do with how Alan Kay/Smalltalk imagined  "object oriented".  To reinforce the obvious, for a man holding only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail 😃 Choose the right abstraction for the job. OO get complex very quicly and hard to reason about, that is for sure 😃

[23-Mar-19 09:53 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
In my honest opinion, things we make today are composite. Object oriented programming just resides on three thingies: inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. C++/Java/C# are pretty much as object oriented as you can get, and not even close to the Alan Kay school of abjekts evvawheewhaa. The languages that belong in that mindset are Python and Ruby. OO doesn't get complex if you apply it as it should be done; any codebase gets complex. Period. That's the result of an organic process and new features.

[23-Mar-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
