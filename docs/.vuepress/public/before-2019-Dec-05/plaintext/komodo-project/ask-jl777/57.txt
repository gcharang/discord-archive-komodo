how can an altcoin chain depend on a close source for consensus level security of their chain?

[01-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ignoring that it is 100x the cost of dPoW

@jl777c what do you think about proof-of-work based on searching for prime numbers ? .Three types of prime chains known as Cunningham chain of first kind, Cunningham chain of second kind and bi-twin chain are qualified as proof-of-work.

[03-Apr-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
there are a couple of such chains already, one of the earliest chains did that

[03-Apr-19 03:09 PM] Regnar#6164
Pretty sure there's prize money for discovery of Mersenne Primes, 51 of them have been found so far, the largest known prime number, 282,589,933-1, having 24,862,048 digits.

[03-Apr-19 03:10 PM] Regnar#6164
Mersenne prime is just a prime number that is one less than a power of two

What is SuperNET NAV currently?  Does anybody here have that calculated? @jl777c

[04-Apr-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
about 20 KMD

[04-Apr-19 06:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
afaik the middle of buy and sell on BarterDEX reflect more or less the NAV so that is very close to 20KMD

yes, that is the automated calc of NAV on the mm1 network that supposedly doesnt work

What if bitcoin core decides the tx spam of vbk has lasted long enough and decides to change the opcodes used by them to limit it. How will this affect dPoW?

[04-Apr-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if they make it so you cant issue tx anymore then we wont be able to use BTC anymore

[04-Apr-19 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Cryptoon the fun/easy solution for that would be to rewrite vbk so that it in some manner uses the opcodes Core added for LN 😈

@Cryptoon for now but all BTC hash is potential BCH hash whereas LTC has no potential and is at max. Plus LTC has no Devs lol.

[05-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
BTC also doesnt have any devs doing anything, so no difference there ;p

[05-Apr-19 12:06 PM] BlackJesus#6161
True true. They are trying to make being lazy cool.

[05-Apr-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
actually BTC devs are VERY active in doing their best to make life hard for all the other coins. first they made the segwit abomination, which made me abandon iguana from being a BTC node as there was no way I was supporting that and if it didnt do BTC, then it really wasnt worth maintaining its full node functionality (though my guess is that it still works find with stable codebase coins)

[05-Apr-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
then they start randomly changing existing rpc calls, BREAKING existing apps

[05-Apr-19 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a big giant no-no. just ask linus what he things about kernel changes that break userspace

[05-Apr-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but legacy devs were not satisfied...

[05-Apr-19 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
they decided to go after all the most commonly used rpc calls to ensure that not just some bitcoin apps broke but all of them did

[05-Apr-19 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
they were nice enough to totally change the behavior of an existing rpc call and then make a new rpc with the old functionality

[05-Apr-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. you read that correctly. instead of keeping the old rpc the same and making the new functionality have a new name (sane and backward compatible) the broke all programs that used getinfo, validateaddress, signrawtransaction, etc.

[05-Apr-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
you would think that is enough

[05-Apr-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
nope

[05-Apr-19 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
now they are totally changing the addresses to a new format

[05-Apr-19 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so BTC 0.14 or 0.15 is what i still use and probably will use for the forseeable future as that is the pre-segwit insanity

Are you asking a question @Don King ? Maybe post that in #talk-other-topics

[06-Apr-19 01:04 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@jl777c Wow Maybe sometime in the future when BTC is dethroned as the most secured chain if BCH where to happen to pick up that position you could double back to that. I could only imagine how fluid Iguana would be hosting both chains natively and being a btc node. Granted I dont regularly run iguana now.

[06-Apr-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be a blockstream plan to slowly "boil the frog" that was BTC. its role is now more as a financial intermediary than technical leadership

[06-Apr-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
granted they still do some cool things like musig. if only they just did productive things in a non-political way, BTC dominance today would still be above 75%

[06-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Mylo#8306
👆 yes i was going to comment earlier but thought little value in continuing the convo - however....some insightful person on reddit said once that they saw the opportunity for  fee market, then a way to make complicated tech on top of it so they became the relevant btc authority - e.g. lightning, liquid etc.

If maintenance of BTC 0.14 and 0.15 stops, can it be a risk for komodo ? About bitcoin recent (and future) changes, I can't agree more: bitcoin devs doesn't know retro-compatibility. Segwit and "removal of getinfo" were developed into yiimp (stratum and payments) but I didn't know for validateaddress and signrawtransaction. I Is it worth to try to adapt iguana to BTC 0.17 ?

[07-Apr-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but without more people helping CHIPS and PANGEA, it will be very slow

[07-Apr-19 01:57 PM] phm87#7395
I had a look a CHIPS, I didn't enough it exists, it's very promising and interesting. I played a little bit with c-lightning (I tried to add it yiimp on testnet) but I prefer LND (more features compared to Blockstream's c-lightning and some features of LND such as PR 2455 should be added into LN specificiations then should be implementated into other LN implementations). I don't know if it can work to adapt LND to work on CHIPS instead of c-lightning. I'll read more about CHIPS and how it works

[07-Apr-19 03:01 PM] phm87#7395
@jl777c  why did you adapt c-lightning and not another implementation od LN such as LND ?

[07-Apr-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
I know C, not the other languages

[07-Apr-19 03:07 PM] phm87#7395
I understand, I have more or less the same problem (that's why I played with clightning before LND)

[07-Apr-19 03:09 PM] phm87#7395
I hope that LND new features (out of LN specs) will be added into LN specs then into clightning and other implementations (PR 2455 of LND allows to pay without receiving an invoice first) as they said. Thank you for your hard work

[07-Apr-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
we only use LN in a hub and spoke topology, to avoid most all its issues

[07-Apr-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but considering how important it is supposed to be for BTC, it is surprising how many issues it still has

[07-Apr-19 03:13 PM] phm87#7395
I was not surprised that Liquid (product of blockstream) already contains the future features of LN (some are already implementated into LND but not into clightning). Good thing here is that the implementations of LN competes with each other

[07-Apr-19 03:14 PM] phm87#7395
I'll read more about CHIPS and how it works, thank you for your help

[07-Apr-19 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but they have to interoperate, so the least common denominator is what matters

[07-Apr-19 03:16 PM] phm87#7395
yes of course, they contains interroperability tests to be sure to work with each other. But it is not forbidden to go beyond the specs. As example, clightning allows to make 1 channel between 2 nodes and make one funding of it while LND allows to have several channels between 2 nodes (and they want to be able to make several fundings of the same channel)

[07-Apr-19 03:17 PM] phm87#7395
but big enhancements (such as PR 2455 of LND) should be added into LN specs (if everyone agrees on it) then all implementations should offer the feature (I hope)

Quick question I'm trying to get CRYPTO Asset overview done.
I remember you sold some BTC at 32k sats for KMD a while ago do you have that in a address that you can share?
Currently I see 11.8k KMD in RXL3YXG   41.23BTC in 1P3rU1Nk1

that is the address the next dividend is coming from, i guess it is a pretty important address. if 41BTC available to convert, maybe a good time to get more at these prices

[08-Apr-19 09:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
nice thank you even more than I thought.
Yes if you have time to consolidate and convert that amount it might be a good time.

How is that 41btc accumulated? From notarizations?

[09-Apr-19 05:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes exactly

[09-Apr-19 05:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
it's 0.000988 BTC per KMD->BTC notarization

[09-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Mark81#4505
So btc collected from ico will flow to original supernet investors in along the road. When btc moon hard during years on away this will also give price support for kmd.

[09-Apr-19 05:19 AM] Mark81#4505
Of course all in kmd.

[09-Apr-19 05:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
It will be paid 95% to Crypto and 5% to REVS if I'm not mistaken SN holds a big amount of Crypto so yes SN holders get some fees collected from the ico via dividends

[09-Apr-19 05:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
and yes it increases the buying power on KMD as dividends are paid in KMD

[09-Apr-19 05:24 AM] Mark81#4505
I'm loving it! Where is crypto for sell?

[09-Apr-19 05:25 AM] CHMEX#0686

How many btc is accumulated in one year. 20btc?

[09-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Mark81#4505
Last time this was paid 2017?

[09-Apr-19 05:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
first and last time was: 25 Dec 2017
1 notarization per block 10 min block time that would be 52 BTC a year will be higher during fee market

[09-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Mark81#4505
When btc goes to 100k this will be epic for kmd, right?

for the whole space yes
