they market themselves as DEX before the tweet of KomodoWorld who suggested to add atomicdex

seems changeNOW (partner of atomicwallet) buy coins and sell them without KYC

The process of exchange

[14-Nov-19 11:51 PM] gigamesh#3544
just isn't a DEX at all as far as i can tell. the only similarity is the lack of KYC

@AtomicWallet @KomodoPlatform Read thru your site and ChangeNOW

I'm a little confused

What exactly makes you an "Atomic Swap DEX"?

Thanks

atomic or not, they listed kmd. perhaps due to demand.

[15-Nov-19 12:10 AM] gigamesh#3544
they call themselves an Atomic Swap DEX

[15-Nov-19 12:11 AM] gigamesh#3544
when really it's a wallet (that you control the keys to, like any ordinary wallet),  which interacts with centralized exchanges

[15-Nov-19 12:15 AM] phm87#7395
maybe they have 64 nodes with multisig ? it decentralize it a little bit ... :troll:

[15-Nov-19 12:16 AM] gigamesh#3544
so i doubt it

[15-Nov-19 12:17 AM] phm87#7395
if they use some CEX to have good prices and liquidity and atomic swap, it can become good if they prepared well their stuff

[15-Nov-19 12:17 AM] gigamesh#3544
they only buy from CEX

[15-Nov-19 12:18 AM] phm87#7395
but I agree with gigamesh, mostly CEX now it seems

[15-Nov-19 12:18 AM] gigamesh#3544
there are no oredrbooks, there is no P2P, and you dont control your funds during the trade

[15-Nov-19 12:19 AM] gigamesh#3544

they will not reply to my q i'll wager

all's fair in crypto. I think I pissed off decred awhile back. havent been back since.

[15-Nov-19 12:39 AM] gigamesh#3544
what id like to know is which pairs are (in their opinion) atomic swapable? ``Use decentralized Atomic Swap to proceed with cross-chain exchange avoiding third party risks.

For coins not yet supported by Atomic Swap, we have built-in ShapeShift, ChangeNOW and Changelly exchanges.``

[15-Nov-19 12:40 AM] gigamesh#3544
> all's fair in crypto

[15-Nov-19 12:42 AM] gigamesh#3544
these guys are pretty big players, buddies with Binance etc. should misnomers pass unchecked?

[15-Nov-19 12:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
should people start caring about telling the truth in crypto? sure. will they anytime soon? I doubt it.

[15-Nov-19 12:45 AM] actionslacks#4072

no advertising, but i've had a very good experience with minipc.eu and their support. they're from .nl and do ship around europe, and they do accept KMD. easily good enough to give a recommendation. especially their support is ridiculously awesome, i'm not joking.

quicker and more useful than in-country stores like media markt. they managed to send replacement ram over a country border over night (to have it at the customer before the weekend comes)... i am... baffled.

DO NOT UPDATE TO ANY WALLET UNLESS IT IS ANNOUNCED HERE. THERE IS NO UPDATE YET AVAILABLE FOR THE VERUS OR KOMODO WALLETS. PLEASE LET OTHERS KNOW BEFORE ANYONE GETS CAUGHT BY THIS.
