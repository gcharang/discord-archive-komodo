In what way is HUSH related to KMD?

[29-Jul-18 01:47 AM] finrecon#0511
@shak3nbak3 i don't know much but Hush has its own channel here under "Ecosystem (3rd party) " in #hush

[29-Jul-18 06:29 AM] grim_chiefer#6001
Since when does KMD take 120 confirmations? Almost an hour to deposit.

[29-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Since asic miners make it a lot easier to 51% attack equihash coins. Exchanges took it as a precaution

[29-Jul-18 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not just kmd but all eauihash coins iirc

[29-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Francis#7833
Guys please vote for KMD's sister coin HUSH to be listed on the https://sonox.io exchange. It requires no info, just a simple click and top 3 placement will give a "capital influx" to HUSH, helping KMD recognition too. There is only a 40 ish votes between us and first place... keep up the momentum, vote daily on as many different wifi/mobile data connections as you can an we could see that number 1 spot!! Much love xx

I wonder how Komodo want to increase blockchain speed without higher the 2mb blocksize or 59sec blocktime? how will this be done?

[29-Jul-18 10:19 AM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
I´m just asking because I want to increase my KMD or DGB portfolio and I´m not sure which one is better. I own both, like them both and DGB seems even faster as KMD and is also very secure in a different way

[29-Jul-18 10:22 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Hagen-von-Coinje  because KMD can use multiple chains instead of a single big one, the chains can do cross transfers with each other, they behave like one but with the load spread among many. Similar effect to sharding but without its problems, security issues, etc...

[29-Jul-18 10:29 AM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
THX that sounds great. I really like these multiple chains concepts. What it does in the question of centralization is another question. DGB, as far as I know will using their singlechain concept, which might get in trouble in a few years, but they will work against that with bigger blocks. the decentralization might be better so?

[29-Jul-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems that many chains is much more decentralized than a single big chain

[29-Jul-18 11:13 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
since users need only to run the blockchain they mostly use, it's more likely they will do so than if they had to download a single big chain

[29-Jul-18 01:13 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
thats the unknown for a non expert like me. Are many chains really more decentralized as one single chain? From the outside I would say that this "ecosystem" must be "managed" or be "controlled" by someone

[29-Jul-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it does rely on being notarized for the cross chain to work. other than that everyting is independent

[29-Jul-18 01:26 PM] Hagen-von-Coinje#9555
hope everything works out well with these architectures,  I´m invested in KMD, Icon, AELF, Aeon and Elastos to diversify a bit in the hope that everyone will succeed in their way.

only question to @Virginia (Peer2Group)

[30-Jul-18 11:59 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's signed with some strange name -> not mine id -> shall I still sign in on the back with my real name id ?

[30-Jul-18 11:59 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or's it's just fine ?

[30-Jul-18 12:14 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I used to use cards with true name, so just want to double check it's fine to have fake that on it 😛 and if I sign in on the back (not valid if not signed) the names on fron and back will be different

[30-Jul-18 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
_wants one in USD_

[30-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Virginia (Peer2Group)#1459
Hi @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 Do you mean if should you sign your card with your nickname or with your real name? The issuer is required by law to request user sign the card, but use your sense common, do what you do with another debit cards

[30-Jul-18 12:20 PM] Virginia (Peer2Group)#1459
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 this card doesn't have any name on the front 😉

[30-Jul-18 01:08 PM] Trax#7469
does somebody know what's the Komodo utility ?

[30-Jul-18 01:23 PM] yorklab#7270
KMD is needed for dPOW, 0 confirmation swaps, upcoming smart contracts, Jumblr in Agama wallet.

[30-Jul-18 01:27 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Virginia (Peer2Group) I see it does have a name - like a generic one XXX Spark

[30-Jul-18 01:27 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
just it will look suspicious when on the back it's different then on the front

[30-Jul-18 01:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but maybe the message "does not require ID " justifies it

[30-Jul-18 01:28 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
