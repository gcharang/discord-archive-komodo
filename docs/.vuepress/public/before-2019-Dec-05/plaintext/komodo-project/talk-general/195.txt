When will KMD be updated on CMC that its listed on Coinbene?

[02-Feb-19 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
likely at some point *after* it's listed and functioning

[02-Feb-19 07:26 PM] Alecandro#1179
I feel like unless we get a ton of people to vote for Komodo, we won’t be in the top 3!

[02-Feb-19 07:30 PM] Alecandro#1179
Have under 2k votes. In dead last 😦

C'mon, @ca333 @metaphilibert - you know answer! Should remember

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] ca333#0118
sorry - even in the weekends we have a lot of work @kolo + it misses a touch of crypto - let our community try it first.

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] ca333#0118
i am sure decker and tony didnt even try yet

[02-Feb-19 08:59 PM] ca333#0118
if you allow me i can post couple of things here to give the othrs a hint

Bottom quote is a german or dutch thing, wonder if that's significant

[02-Feb-19 09:09 PM] Decker#3767
About Blackbeard's puzzle it's total unclear too ... Good puzzle can be solved without any "hints", users should clearly know where he should start. Hint "see the dots" gives nothing. I'm already tried even to extract each section name in hex from this dots and combine passphrase. Nothing )

also looked at that section divider thing 😃

[02-Feb-19 09:11 PM] Decker#3767
I can tell you more - i tried every single word from this interview - nothing )))

[02-Feb-19 09:11 PM] Gawain#7858
haha

[02-Feb-19 09:11 PM] Gawain#7858
i tried various lists that start with bullet points

[02-Feb-19 09:11 PM] Decker#3767
May be something in interview is missing? )) Like, ca333 gives the answer, but Blackbeard just forget to post it in article )))

[02-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Gawain#7858
although punctuation is a bit tricky without clue

[02-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Decker#3767
First hint forces as to look at the end ... Second hint to see the dots ...

[02-Feb-19 09:12 PM] Gawain#7858
the ... were visible in bitcointalk image so i tried various things from that bitcointalk thread too lol

Don't like puzzles that can not be solved without "hints" ... It should be solveable itself, without additional info, like "you should add something at the end" ... But what you need to add - i'll tell you later )

[02-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Gawain#7858
`Mobile, Mobile, Mobile!` has 3 dots too, but also wrong 😃

[02-Feb-19 09:19 PM] SHossain#0007
@Decker i have a puzzle for us. we need to get static binary builds for few things :abusedsmily:

[02-Feb-19 09:20 PM] Decker#3767
@SHossain We are working on this "puzzle" also )

[02-Feb-19 09:20 PM] SHossain#0007

[02-Feb-19 09:21 PM] SHossain#0007
Once we have the static builds,  you can post a nice puzzle based on that. i'll put there 77.7 KMD

[02-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Gawain#7858

tbh its a lot of guesswork regardless, but it's fun in small amounts 😃

_is fearful that in 3987 people will still be attempting to solve whatever puzzle @Decker designs_

[02-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
tip for @Blackbeard his puzzle - its really just **IN the interview text**. The rest is irrelevant (no pictures, no non-interview things, look only at the text).

[02-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
and the dots

[02-Feb-19 09:53 PM] ca333#0118
@Blackbeard will have one more hint for you.

@Blackbeard time to push the last hint?

the hints means basically read the text - watch out for dots cuz they are like checkpoints. kinda.. but blackbeard has to release the last hint - then it should be clear.

[02-Feb-19 11:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
this puzzle stuff is getting serious

number of dots per paragraph `42431432533332` and including the question `52441432533332`

[03-Feb-19 12:12 AM] Decker#3767
i'm tried to combine words after dots, or words before dots, or every word in article with "." in the end ... wrong way ...

[03-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Gawain#7858
Yeah, I ran out of ideas so just waiting 😃

[03-Feb-19 01:16 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
I wonder if the "to the very end" hint has anything to do with "end user apps" I tried a few things but no luck

[03-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Decker#3767
I have other idea ... seems the key is not just a word from text. We have 4 groups of dots in text, like:
```
...
some text 1
...
some text 2
...
some text 3
...
```
Final passphrase can consist of 3 words, the describing the meaning of text1 + text2 + text3 ...

[03-Feb-19 01:21 AM] williamkeffer93#6847
Yeah this puzzle seems out there hopefully with 4th hint will become clear

@Gawain once again you have been very close with one of your ideas. VERY close.

[03-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Alecandro#1179
Damn there’s some bigggg news in that report!! The 2019 plans about building a custom blockchain generator with AWS? That’s incredible. Can’t wait until we see Amazon announce partnerships and dive into blockchain space

[03-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Alecandro#1179
Damn that’s crazy. Makes me so excited for the rest of 2019

[03-Feb-19 03:04 AM] Gawain#7858
amazon seems to really miss the point - blockchain doesn't mean decentralized

[03-Feb-19 03:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not exactly

[03-Feb-19 03:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You use terh AWS to spint up the starting nodes to create the blockchain... This has always been a hard part for users. Once the chain is started and the AWS nodes are used as seeds then it out in the wild and anyone can sync it and mine it. If people are using it and minieg it then the AWS nodes then can be switcvhed off.. 
It allows people to easily create lots of diff chains, with difffrent params, quickly and easily.

[03-Feb-19 03:08 AM] Alecandro#1179
That is so cool haha

[03-Feb-19 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Using AWS now in my gateways tests - buying quite cheap spot nodes for a few hours, then in a few clicks spin X nodes from pre-created snapshot

With KMD labs we made a way to notarise these chains with as littlke as 2 notary nodes, so you will be able to have dPoW for cross chain, contracts as stuff with it aswell.. Once I get time to go help them with it.

[03-Feb-19 03:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Obviously, using just 2 notary nodes is in no wayt secure... But for development... it is perfectly fine and very cheap.

[03-Feb-19 01:02 PM] ca333#0118
like @blackjok3r pointed out this is not just a "create your blockchain automagically in under a minute" system - it is far more. Thanks for #kmdlabs for example we re integrating the dpow-lite technology to offer freshly created chains BTC level security quasi instantly! And the features listed above and mentioned in this channel arent even everything. We wont disclose the full details due to the copycats in the industry - however, you all know who did it a) first and b) solid. We have been working on this for over tha last half year.
