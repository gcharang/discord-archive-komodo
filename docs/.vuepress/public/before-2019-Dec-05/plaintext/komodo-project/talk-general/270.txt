Hello everyone :).
As some of you may already know, this year, I'm candidating for a node in **SH region**.
The past year has been very nice : I learned so much thanks to you all who supported me, it was really amazing.
So amazing that I try to contribute more and more, and to find ideas that could help the community. This led me to the creation of a project called **Barterlly**, and here's the true reason behind my proposal : 
I believe this app, and its future versions can be the starting point of something very useful for the community and help spread the word and attract users and devs into KMD ecosystem : Any dpowed assetchain / coin will automatically be listed on the platform (and all "derivative" ones yet to come ;) )

I won't go into tech details on this post, and will just wish you a good election time, but don't forget ! 

**Support Barterlly, Vote for dwy !** : RKUV7wkP4yTR1suVYLicf4ZaooQzz8u5iR

@halo kitty rules very cool that an ATM supports KMD! Unfortunately, that ATM is all closed source software

[18-Apr-19 11:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
Coinflip supporting only 7 currencies and KMD is one of them, that is pretty cool

Does it matter so much if its closed source
