the node automation was dev cause I had a job and no way to have a ssh during the day :p

[16-Apr-19 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
I also wanted to share and have a way to monitor any node without any harm

[16-Apr-19 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
just with a json sending

[16-Apr-19 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
nothing else

cause at start we had to rely on different branchez and a way of tracking this without risk

[16-Apr-19 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
is to just produce a standarfized json at regular interval

[16-Apr-19 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
deposit this to a webserv and you got notarystats.com

[16-Apr-19 01:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
I wznted it to be spread to all NN, but noone seemed to consider those infos crucial, or at least not enough

[16-Apr-19 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
so deprecated lazynode and moved on

[16-Apr-19 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
But the goal was also to refine the notary network

[16-Apr-19 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
am sure with a basic script without any dependency we can produce a wellformed json

[16-Apr-19 01:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
any op just need to push it to a designatef webserver and we have a real live monitoring

[16-Apr-19 01:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
but in case of emergency... knowing who is on what branch is imo very important and we can make direct calls to operators and be more precise

[16-Apr-19 01:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
instead of saying : please update

[16-Apr-19 01:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
don t get cocky we ll get attacked and noone is awaken 24/7

[16-Apr-19 01:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
so with a *yes I know it feels baaaad, but* centralized json... we basically can have live alerts on anything (I realize we re on general, sry)

I fear unless the  amount of SH nodes is increased, it will always relatively suck compared to AR/EU/NA 😦

[16-Apr-19 01:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The thing we should really focus on is nerfing the ping advantage of iguana without comprimising reliability of ntoarizations.

[16-Apr-19 01:23 AM] PTYX#6840
maybe placing them in places other than australia will help. we're looking for options in south america.

[16-Apr-19 01:23 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That will; amke node in Aus even worse 😄

[16-Apr-19 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can make SH better if you put all nodes in Brazil

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Apr-19 01:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that doesnt really achaive anything... the idea is to have nodes in as many countries as possible

[16-Apr-19 01:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
With the current system there is no way that is going to happen, because greed...

#notarynode may be more adapted

[16-Apr-19 01:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
but we may have a workaround for this

[16-Apr-19 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
people don t like this idea

[16-Apr-19 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
but well executed it can be handy

[16-Apr-19 01:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Its a good discussion for everyone to see imo

[16-Apr-19 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
just use alternate networks

[16-Apr-19 01:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
And no tor dwy

[16-Apr-19 01:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
:P

[16-Apr-19 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
performance is an issue with tor

[16-Apr-19 01:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
and maybe also regulations in spexif countries

[16-Apr-19 01:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We tried tor it falt out does not work I can tell you right now

[16-Apr-19 01:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll try it if I got the chance to, this year

[16-Apr-19 01:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also creating our own tor ... where you use notary nodes themselgf to ping packets a random number of times before arrivinga t destination, will not work as statistically over time, nodes close to each other will still group together.

[16-Apr-19 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The answer is to just slow down revcmask a bit but not too mcuh.. I still dont know how to do this though.

[16-Apr-19 01:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Go too far with it and the entire network just gets slower, and you will also reward crappy nodes with bad ops that dont know how tro run them with even counts.

[16-Apr-19 01:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol

[16-Apr-19 01:45 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There is a fine line between a "crappy" node, and a node that doesnt work though

[16-Apr-19 01:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
YEs that is the problem with slowing it down. It would be a hardforking change, so a testnet would be needed (liekly with 64 ndoes aswell) so not an easy task to tune it right.

Is there a Komodo channel on WeChat? I've been reading more and more recently that many people from China are asking for a Chinese komodo channel, and that discord is blocked in china. China is a big market as we all know, maybe you should be active there....?!

Online poker definitely needs revolutionised. Is there going rake?

[16-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
each person that runs dealer node can set the rake

[16-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
part of it goes to PANGEA

[16-Apr-19 12:48 PM] MdAmazing#4020

hi guys a quick question about asset chain 
create a 100% pos coin with half premine and max coin at double of premine 

./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=5000000000 
-ac_end=20000 -ac_staked=100 & 

it's correct?

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] jorian#4555
@blackjok3r or @Alright will advise you not to make a 100% pos chain

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] Alright#0419
not uhhh

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] jorian#4555
but if you want it, then it seems correct

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] $tefano.#3560
indeed it's my question ..

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] Alright#0419
That is fine, just understand how to properly distribute UTXOs

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] $tefano.#3560
best to have 99 pos and 1 pow?

[16-Apr-19 02:16 PM] jorian#4555
apart from the space between supply and reward

[16-Apr-19 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
100% PoS > 100% PoW

[16-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Alright#0419
I have a script that will start them for you and manage UTXOs automatically if you like

[16-Apr-19 02:17 PM] Alright#0419
100% POS is fine
