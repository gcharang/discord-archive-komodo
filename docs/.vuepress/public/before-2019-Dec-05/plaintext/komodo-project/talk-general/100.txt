well the identified "flaw" was the always known fact that until it is notarized it can be reorged. that is why it is called delayed PoW

@Jacobstoon @cryptorecorder @KomodoPlatform @Bitcoin @ethereum @VerusCoin No doubt, I love the fact that @VerusCoin coin’s revolutionary CPU mining algo will be implemented in $kmd soon. Mining with a CPU and getting better hashrate than a GFX card.

runtime forks will be able to select verushash

[15-Oct-18 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
existing chains would need a hardfork to change algo and there is no plan to chain KMD from equihash

Has the 350 BTC buyer recently increased his price to .000175 ?  They seem determined to obtain 2 million KMD at these low prices.   Good luck!

10% spike in BTC occurred hours before the Fidelity announcement: so there was clear insider trading and/or exchanges that were front-running their clients. In any other market the SEC would investigate & folks would end up in jail. Not in this crypto cesspool of manipulat...

[15-Oct-18 10:18 PM] Hermes#6934
If it helps I have used AMD for 5 years and only had to repair the card once...in one of old machines so for quality is good .

[15-Oct-18 10:20 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I still have a computer rocking a AMD Phenom II X4 965. Used it to mine VRSC. It found one block in a week.

[15-Oct-18 10:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Hermes I used AMD only for like a decade, but until recently AMD had a bad max RAM issue and that's why I went back to Intel to begin with, otherwise I'd have stayed with AMD

[15-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
Which surprises me because it shouldn't have worked.

[15-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Hermes#6934
Yeah it's a tricky choice if you are seeing that type of issues with the Ram

[15-Oct-18 10:23 PM] Hermes#6934
didn't knew about it

[15-Oct-18 10:23 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i suspect RAM

[15-Oct-18 10:24 PM] SHossain#0007
probably mined few blocks of verus when block reward was 96

[15-Oct-18 10:25 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The RAM "issue" I had was that Intel had a higher max than AMD

@SHossain Do you think the 32 core is worth getting (pretend price isn't an issue)?

not really.
i'm happy with i7-8700k
