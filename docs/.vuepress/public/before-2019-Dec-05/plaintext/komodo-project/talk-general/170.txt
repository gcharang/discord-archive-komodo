so now hubs are charging for routing info?

[10-Jan-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
what prevents a hub from only publishing routes using its own affiliated set of hubs?

[10-Jan-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we end up with half a dozen major hubs that everybody routes through

[10-Jan-19 12:48 PM] garbonzo607#4659
I'm just wondering if the centralized system can be replicated in a trustless manner. Perhaps no need to reinvent the wheel.

[10-Jan-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it can, maybe it cant. doing this is exactly the very difficult problem of decentralized systems and LN did not solve this (yet), nor is there anything that appears to be close to solving it

[10-Jan-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but in 6 months it will take over the world, just 6 months to go

like making a DEX, even after you solve the core tech, there are still many usability issues to solve

[10-Jan-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the routing and incentives for LN hubs seems left to its own devices

[10-Jan-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the fundamental problem is that if hubs are making money, then the txfees arent being reduced

[10-Jan-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
which was one of the big points about LN that was supposed to compensate for its being an interactive protocol and not noninteractive

[10-Jan-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
given some large nonprofit that funds development for routing services and pays the costs of these nodes, then I can see how I could solve the dynamic routing issue.

[10-Jan-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
but i dont have much motivation to do it

[10-Jan-19 12:57 PM] garbonzo607#4659
You say maybe it can't, but it works in my noob mind. I feel like every economic action that requires trust can just replace trust with crypto deposits and trust is no longer needed. We can't prevent bad things from happening, but we can make sure we are made whole with the appropriate compensation. I know there's a lot of building to do to get to that world, but why wouldn't it be possible? We have the building blocks.

Also where can I read where CC solves the nothing at stake problem? Doesn't ETH have like a 3 year plan trying to solve this problem? How is it solved? When will a chain implement a PoS mechanism using it?

Do Komodo projects not need sharding, since they can just create multiple blockchains, or is sharding still useful?

[10-Jan-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding is like going from an omelet to the original eggs (and ingredients)

[10-Jan-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
with KMD method, you never even mix the eggs together, there is nothing to shard (a very very complex problem that makes LN routing look simple)

[10-Jan-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
why to combine things into a single chain, just to separate them out again (sharding)?

[10-Jan-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
why not just have dedicated chains for each usage, then only people that care about that would even load that chain

[10-Jan-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
its one of those common sense things that is too simple, so it doesnt get a lot of cool sounding jargon

[10-Jan-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing more needs to be done if you can make a set of chains fungible with each other, securely

I wonder if that ETH notarization service libscott made in 2018 can be of use for that.
It notarized on KMD and had a ETH lite node running

Its their lose if they dont read about it.

[10-Jan-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
after I explained how all nodes on the network validate all proposed notarizations (sort of definition of decentralized), one of them said they are tired of centralized solutions being pitched to them.

[10-Jan-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i wouldnt place any high hopes on them, they seem to be stuck on "checkpoint" it must be centralized and dont hear the part about where it is a decentralized checkpoint

@Scruffycoder most exchanges don't have an age requirement and there are some that you can use without identification under a certain limit.

[10-Jan-19 09:57 PM] PTYX#6840
I think I've only seen one or two exchange ask about age. It should definitely be prohibited to trade under a certain age though. Self regulation would be great but most exchanges don't care about that. They care about profits.
