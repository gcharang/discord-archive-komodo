[05-Mar-19 11:23 AM] cipi#4502
@cryptopleb LTC/DGB-orderbook is empty, same with VTC/DGB... try LTC/KMD or DGB/KMD or VTC/KMD... and always take a look in the orderbook first 😉

@fredrik the cost it takes to run 10 virtual machines to run each chain on them

[05-Mar-19 12:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you want someone to create 10 tokens for you, contact #chainzilla @PTYX or #chainmakers @jorian

Looking for a developer (or potential partner) to develop smart contracts with Komodo. If you have prior experience with smart contracts with Ethereum/solidity that would be an advantage (yet not necessary). Understanding of scaling a must. Initial offer is for a short period (2 weeks), with potential long term contract > 2 years. We're a Dutch company, healthy and 8+ years in production (being a native Dutch speaker would be great, yet not mandatory). Our core team is 5 people, with a range of freelancers a grand total of 20. Oh, and we publish comics and games. DM me, if you feel you're up for the job with a short intro about you, your skills and what you have done with Komodo so far. ❤

[05-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptoon ah, thanks for the referral 😃 Isn't chainmakers a part of Komodo? Or does ecosystem mean something different

[05-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(sorry new to the Komodo scene)

[05-Mar-19 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Third party consultant ish I guess

[05-Mar-19 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But they also run 2 notary nodes so are very active within the ecosystem 😃

[05-Mar-19 12:53 PM] jorian#4555
we are our own corporation, but have close ties to the komodo ecosystem indeed

[05-Mar-19 12:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
with own corp, you mean you offer specific services (hosting/PaaS/SaaS) ?

[05-Mar-19 12:55 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[05-Mar-19 12:55 PM] jorian#4555

[05-Mar-19 12:56 PM] jorian#4555
yes, the website tells a bit about that

[05-Mar-19 12:56 PM] jorian#4555
our goal is to help people get introduced in Komodo Platform

[05-Mar-19 12:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
looking at the website, I think that would be more fit for a future plan. At this point, I want to demonstrate / research potential for our VC partner; probably too mickey mouse level for you guys @jorian but I'll keep it in mind

[05-Mar-19 12:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(probably gonna need that developer to help to design a proper plan for your services)

@KomodoWorld  71272 notarizations  154.922 BTC that is our all time numbers, Veriblock much much more wasteful

[05-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
They made 6M transactions for 76BTC, kmd made 71k tx for 76 BTC?

[05-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Seems like relatively speaking veriblock is cheaper though :p

[05-Mar-19 03:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

“Ryo, a cryptocurrency derived from Monero, reports in its Medium post that its team fixed this vulnerability seven months ago. The post justifies the lack of a responsible disclosure towards the Monero team earlier by noting Monero’s “long history of toxic behaviour towards security researchers.”

Everyone on XMR I talk with is doomsday about the trusted setup.  

Yet, 2-3 forks per year to “keep asics” off the network is ok.  Pushing out forks early because of it is fine.   I mean why develop a coin for security and ease of use if you’ve gotta continue forking in order to keep your GPU farms profitable. 🤷‍♂️

[05-Mar-19 03:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
**Hopes KMD can add ZKStarks to remove the trusted setup and really set the z rocket off!**

It's a perfectly logical concept if you ignore the fact that reality exists 🙂

@fredrik best to ask in #support

[05-Mar-19 04:12 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
thanks @polycryptoblog so Sep 2018 - feb 2019 should be ~14500 notarizations and ~30 BTC

[05-Mar-19 05:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yep, about 1/4 of the total, for a quick approximate

[05-Mar-19 05:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Actually less sorry , 1/5.  , kmd has been around 5x as long

[05-Mar-19 05:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
6/76 = 30/x  x=380 ,  they would have spent 380 BTC and like ~30 million transactions if they were around as long as us ( even more factoring in high fee period )

Is the DPOW centralized? i.e. what is signing BTC transactions every 10 minutes

[05-Mar-19 06:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One of a random 64 Notary nodes that are elected.  8 ( I believe) Are automatically provided to developers to provide income and resources - 24 are Automatically renewed each year if they are top performing - 32 new ones are elected each election period annually, the next one hopefully being in April/May.

[05-Mar-19 06:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Notaries only additional authorities are to mine blocks at a lower difficulty so they can input the hash of KMD and it's asset chains onto BTC. 
They cannot change the blocks, add or remove transactions or censor anything that passes through.  
They simply have lower mining difficulties in order to facilitate the Hash Recording to BTC.  

As I understand it on a "simple" level.  
Hope that helps @LeshAft9

`u always have to consider every possible scenario`
True.
In that case, the unicorns would create a new coin whereby 51% of the entire crypto community isn't competing for 24% of all minabale KMD

the principle reasoning behind dPoW is security, if you have that much security in 24% of the mining cycle, then you have something that can never be undone
