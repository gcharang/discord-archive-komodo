@finchify @ActualAdviceBTC @sheos_org @KomodoPlatform Since when is 0.0001 KMD 0.01$? And since when is 0.0001 of the cc chain on which the dApp is running even anywhere close to 0.01$? But sure feel free to run everything on the same, soon to be conjested network at no tx...

the best model is where nobody has to pay exorbinant fees, and if your dapp isnt worth spending $0.00001 per action then maybe it isnt going to be a successful dapp

[19-Oct-18 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if 0.0001 KMD is $0.01, I may have to find that exchange and may have a hard time not dumping everything I have and arb every other exchange :trollface:

He likes the Zen 51% because it would be an easy install to ZCL (same codebase) - less work than Duke did to get KMD notarisations into Hush. Also it would have no ongoing payments to nataries  - but in the end Zen's implementation is only a dis-incentive.

[19-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Seko#7408
I need your help for a moment to clear up a misunderstanding.

Has the attack on EMC2 now been stopped by hashpower Einsteiniums or dPoW? 

I saw the sudden increase of hashpower Einsteinium‘s myself, but Einsteinium himself thanks Komodo for dPoW.

What now?  Own hashpower or dPoW?

[19-Oct-18 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the first attack was due to hashrate

[19-Oct-18 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the second attack was blocked via dPoW

[19-Oct-18 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
first attack was not done due to hashrate and knowledge about dPoW

[19-Oct-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
second attack was done in spite of knowing about dPoW, and it was under worst possible network conditions with the majority of the network running non-updated nodes. and nodes not running dPoW are not protected by it. still dPoW protected the network and after the attack stopped the old nodes converged back to the notarized main chain

Okay... I was watching Geocold's first attack live.  There it was the suddenly high Hashrate on the part of EMC2.

During the second attack a few days later we are talking about Forkwitch?  Then here lies the misunderstanding.

[19-Oct-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, first was geocold, second was forkwitch

I have talked with a few CryptoNote coins about DPoW, they are interested in anything that helps against 51% attacks, which they experience just the same

[19-Oct-18 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
nicehash is the 51% enabler, much more than ASIC
