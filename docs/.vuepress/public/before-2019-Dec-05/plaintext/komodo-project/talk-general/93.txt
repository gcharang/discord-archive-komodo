The #kmdlabs  project is proud to present its first dApp STAKEDTROLL!
It is a terminal application for chatting on the blockchain. It is secured by dPoW and has a block time of as close to instant as it seems possible. 
I am looking for testers. It runs on debain based linux only, no windows allowed 😛 
https://github.com/StakedChain/staked
I have written noob friendly instructions on how to use it i the following git repo, although some basic command line and linux skills will be required. This is a great introduction to crypto conditions and leverages the faucet contract along with the existing KV storage avalible on KMD assetchains.

On what planet does `one of the best write-ups on "privacy coins"` tell people to **not** use an actual privacy coin because `limited tooling makes it hard for the average user`, as opposed to saying "you can actually secure your shit by learning to type 4 lines"?

Bitcoin is private..... as long as 'private' means you want anyone to be able to see everything you do, where it all came from, and where it all went.
