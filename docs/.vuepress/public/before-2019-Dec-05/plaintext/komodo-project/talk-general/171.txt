Can someone respond to this criticism of Komodo:

"Komodo has 64 trusted "notary nodes", and they get elected every year.
Elections are not cryptoeconomically secure. 

Once you abandon cryptoeconomically security, it is easy to process transactions super fast.
But you have a product that isn't interesting.
If someone can steal your money, it doesn't matter how fast it is."

[11-Jan-19 09:40 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's a misconception that NN are miners or stakers and influence consensus

[11-Jan-19 09:41 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it works totally different, this is not delegated-PoS

[11-Jan-19 09:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's funny people would rather have their projects die than to take a few minutes to learn what it does.

[11-Jan-19 09:45 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
and it has nothing to do with fast tx, really they're assuming NN can decide blocks

[11-Jan-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Technically the scaleing solution requires trust in yuor notary nodes....

[11-Jan-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Because they are the ones who decide which chains are fungible

[11-Jan-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
for everything else... Notary is a normal node... no speical powers

[11-Jan-19 10:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Has to be said it is a collective trust also.... all notaries must agree on which chains are fungible. May be possible for enough of them to make up the minimum sigs to notarise a chain enough times to get a migrate through. Seems hard to pull off though.

[11-Jan-19 11:05 AM] garbonzo607#4659
I skimmed this, but I'm trying to digest it: https://blog.komodoplatform.com/delayed-proof-of-work-explained-9a74250dbb86

It also doesn't talk about the scaling solution, like you said, @blackjok3r. I would like a summary of the worst case scenario.

[11-Jan-19 11:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what do you mean worst case senario ? 
The scaling solution has fungible chains, so if every notary node conspired to create a new chain, with a huge premine than notarise it in the cluster, then they can inflate supply. This is unlikely to happen. But it could eb done none the less.

[11-Jan-19 11:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
For #kmdlabs  we are trying to think of many ways to stop this even being possible... you need to game theory it out, so that the notaries dopnt have enconmic incentive to band together to do this...

[11-Jan-19 11:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To me... if they are already earnming enough coins, it would be suicide to inflate the supply, because you decrease the value of existing coins.

[11-Jan-19 11:10 AM] garbonzo607#4659
It's feasible that a state actor can corrupt all notaries using power / force. What if notaries were anonymous, their locations anonymous, and they are chosen randomly after meeting a minimum criteria requirement?

[11-Jan-19 11:13 AM] garbonzo607#4659
If that's possible, it might be as cryptoeconomically secure as BTC imo.

[11-Jan-19 11:35 AM] garbonzo607#4659
The other solution to scalability in my opinion is designing a system that requires a deposit that is worth equal to the total amount of damage that can be cause by an attack. If we can see an attack for what it is, we don't have to worry about money being stolen. The worst that can happen is a hard fork. But hard forking will obviously disrupt financial transactions for a certain amount of time, until people are migrated to the truthful chain. How much damage can this cause? We don't know. It's up to every person transacting at the moment. The higher the deposit required, the higher the fee will be, obviously. So it's a lot like insurance, but this insurance will be cheaper, because the insurer has control over whether the insured event occurs.

[11-Jan-19 11:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
One idea we had to launch chains int he cluster was to burn the supply and add the chain params to OP_RETURN.... Then you can use the crosschain to check the tx has happend and was notarisaed before launching the chain... For now this will be a manual process but if ut can be coded.... then notaries themselvs cant even cheat.

[11-Jan-19 12:29 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Interesting. But the article I linked above talked about a possible way to double spend if all notaries colluded? Is that true?

"My claim is that dPoW isn’t perfect, but, for a chain without a large hash-rate, it sure is better than not having dPoW. — jl777"

I don't like this quote. Is Komodo trying to just be better than chains without a large hash-rate, or is Komodo the tech that allows crypto to go mainstream?

[11-Jan-19 12:34 PM] PTYX#6840
What don't you like or understand about the quote?

[11-Jan-19 01:30 PM] garbonzo607#4659
It makes it seem like DPoW is only suited for chains without a large hash-rate. It makes it seem inferior to chains like Ethereum for instance.

[11-Jan-19 01:36 PM] blackjok3r#3181
dPoW is a cheap and energy efficiant way to secure a blockchain... The idea is you can have single use chains, so it scales to infinity.... Without having to need large hash rates on them all.

[11-Jan-19 01:40 PM] garbonzo607#4659
The real question is, what tech will make blockchain go mainstream? Komodo is a competitor to Ethereum if Ethereum thinks it doesn't need Komodo, even though they aren't the same thing. For example, if your co-worker thinks they can take over your job at a cheaper cost to your employer, they are a competitor, even if you do two different jobs. Does that make sense? It's all about whether Komodo is needed for mainstream crypto adoption or not.

[11-Jan-19 01:42 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Sorry

[11-Jan-19 01:42 PM] garbonzo607#4659
So you're saying dPoW may not be needed, but the rest of Komodo may be?

[11-Jan-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`The real question is, what tech will make blockchain go mainstream? `
"blockchain" in and of itself going "mainstream" is meaningless; it's just a ledger format

[11-Jan-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

I don't want to spell it out all the time 😆

[11-Jan-19 01:49 PM] garbonzo607#4659
"The part that competes with Ethereum is about tokenization. Komodo has broader capabilities, by addressing the problem from a different perspective." Yeah but how will it be secured? I don't want to make it seem like business / corporate competition, but friendly competition. A competition of ideas. What *is* actually the best way to secure peer to peer cash?

`What is actually the best way to secure peer to peer cash?`
There is no *the best* way, we all have our biases and presuppositions.
Anyone here will likely answer PoW, some feel PoS, some feel hybrid, some feel it hasn't come yet...

[11-Jan-19 01:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`a crypto more secure but more expensive?`
A lot of expense is hype

[11-Jan-19 01:55 PM] garbonzo607#4659
In reality, one is more secure than the other. If we ask enough questions and perform enough tests, we should be able to gather enough evidence for one or the other.

[11-Jan-19 01:56 PM] garbonzo607#4659
"Komodo wins at security thanks to dPoW, for a cost, of course."

Will the scaling solution help with cost, or will there always be added cost?

[11-Jan-19 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
"more secure" is a subjective concept
There are undoubtedly several already know ways to defeat many types of security across the space (just because you don't know about a lapse in security doesn't mean that none exist).
`KMD isn't for free`
Actually, if you compare the cost to have the equivalent hash power, dPoW kinda is

[11-Jan-19 01:59 PM] garbonzo607#4659
Of course not free. I meant *added* cost. Over something like Ethereum with Casper, sharding, plasma, etc.

Honestly I'm just trying to figure out how peer to peer solutions can economically out-value centralized ones first, and then, how certain peer to peer solutions can out-value other peer to peer solutions. First, I want to know my financial transactions are secure, then, I want to pay as little as possible for that to happen.

[11-Jan-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If just transfer of value.... then dPoW to chains under BTC seems a good solution....

[11-Jan-19 02:05 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That is ... as long as BTC has enough hash power to be secure

[11-Jan-19 02:07 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I'm just trying to figure out how peer to peer solutions can economically out-value centralized ones first`

Let's get back to the original point. JL777 said dPoW isn't perfect. I don't like the implications. Nothing is perfect, but is it good enough for mainstream, and is it better than any other solution right now?

[11-Jan-19 02:09 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in our opinion, yes

"Same goes for BTC miners... gun to the head. 
Nothing is perfect." People have a problem with 51 pieces of chewing gum holding back a dam. BTC has a lot more than 51, and don't mention mining pools as it isn't the same as notaries.

[11-Jan-19 02:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There are more notaries than BTC mining pools

@KomodoWorld  I think hes talking about the scaling solution, which mean if you get 51 notaries then you can inflate the supply by creating extra fungible chains.

ah ok, that is different, I hope kmdlabs can find a definitive solution

[11-Jan-19 02:16 PM] garbonzo607#4659
If dPoW uses BTC hash rate, why are we bashing BTC's PoW as a security model? Doesn't make sense to me. Not that it has to use BTC, but it has the most hash rate right now.

plus only 1/2 of them are up for election on a given year
you'd have to buy all of them over multiple years **AND** buy enough supply to ensure they got elected each year

[11-Jan-19 03:00 PM] gcharang#6833
Also the important thing is: the only bad thing notaries can do is withhold notarizations. And for a notarized chain its best practice to not consider a transaction final until it is notarized. So if the notarizations are not coming in, there is   a problem and you shouldn't accept transactions. So there are no double spends
