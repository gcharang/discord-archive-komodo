I asked cmc to list devsec, even with the volume in place it was a negative

Unfortunately DEVSEC does not meet our requirements for listing at this time. Please feel free to re-apply when this project has become more established.

[21-Jun-18 11:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Probably just lack of provable community

[21-Jun-18 11:52 AM] PTYX#6840
But that can be fixed

[21-Jun-18 11:53 AM] PTYX#6840
Devsec doesn't have a full Twitter, reddit, and just recently got a bitcointalk

[21-Jun-18 11:53 AM] PTYX#6840
I wouldn't try to get it listed either until CA333 says go ahead

[21-Jun-18 11:53 AM] PTYX#6840
Because that could attract unwanted attention to devsec before they have even gotten started

[22-Jun-18 10:36 AM] ca333#0118
@CHMEX thanks for the efforts anyway. yes - i think its better to wait a little bit since we just got started. i am not going to engage community wise and prefer to stay in the background. 
The volume does not meet the listing requirement neither. CMC stated to me some long time ago that the source of trading-volume also plays a big role. My plan is to wait at least a week till we have regular volume on barterDEX and then apply while the hackathon campaign is ongoing.

so the community part will be covered by a dedicated community manager we are negotiating with as we speak.

[09-Sep-18 05:18 PM] jspook16#3059

[01-Oct-18 11:49 AM] Mark81#4505
Any relations sec chain with dsec?

[02-Oct-18 01:35 PM] ca333#0118
yes @Mark81 will provide more info soon - GUI is work in pro

[02-Oct-18 01:42 PM] Mark81#4505
I noticed that chain is mineable. Is there reason for it?

[02-Oct-18 01:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
pretty much all assetchains are mineable @Mark81 , but if not specified the block rewards are only 0.0001

[02-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Mark81#4505
It has 3sec block reward.

[02-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Mark81#4505
3SEC coins.

No it doesn't, the 3 for block reward is a carry over from KMD explorer stats

[02-Oct-18 02:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
look at the actual mined tx's: http://sec.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/605a0593202e076a07c11d9203985ada7adf88a4a588bd5964fe3f6e9e85ef6b

[02-Oct-18 02:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
SEC has no `ac_reward=` param

[02-Oct-18 03:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
Sorry looks like I missed to update that one

[08-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Diesmaster#5068
@ca333 Are you still looking for devs?

[10-Oct-18 04:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.   

DM me for the link and I will get you setup with the creator.

ticket #13238 Karl: "I am still unable to access KMD. I have downloaded the mobile wallet and utilized the old seed and password to create wallet...account still shows KMD = 0. I have downloaded the desktop and followed the instructions to stop the proxy server (it wasn't active on my settings so I just left it alone.) I do not know/understand how to access the address where you say  my coins are. Please advise.
