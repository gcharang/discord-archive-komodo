when you want to test integration, some stuff probably next month - hard to say atm, but your tokenized assets are already in testing.

[07-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Mylo#8306
we have a network upgrade in 3 weeks, so testing tokenized assets won't be only focus.

[07-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Mylo#8306
just to be a bit real about the rest of this month 😃
