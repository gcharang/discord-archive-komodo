[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> "Didn't know you we're a part of game credits"  yeah, I was one of the team that took it over when the original devs abandoned it. Worked on it for about a year, life got in the way. The other five guys got rich. I chose Incryptex over them. Made the wrong choice, but hindsight is 20/20, right?

[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I'm gonna look at activating blacklist for URL's

[27-Jul-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Biomech-Founder> It was probably harmless, a paper writing thing, but not appropriate. I think I let it sit for about ten seconds 😄

[27-Jul-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> Ive seen it before, could be a link to something malicious., I read somewhere discord crypto communities are being attacked, possibly with malicious links

[27-Jul-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I got a screenshot of it once but forgot to save it, I will add it to a blacklist

[27-Jul-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
