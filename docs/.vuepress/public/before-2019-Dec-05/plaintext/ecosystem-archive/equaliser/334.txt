[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> actually he has given his manifesto that he will make 1 million houses for poor and under privileged people in 100 days

[17-Aug-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> so yeah I think EQLI team should contact

[17-Aug-18 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <ECA Gorillaz> Wow imagine

[17-Aug-18 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> a good market as i see it for EQLI

[17-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> because if it gets project in Pakistan, India will also feel interested in looking at it. because both the countries are poor and have millions under poverty line

[17-Aug-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> so will Srilanka and many south Asian countriess

[17-Aug-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Revitalising Economic Growth
Asad Umar presented the economic highlights of the proposed agenda, which includes provision of jobs to youth and promotion of tourism.

He said that a policy to create 10 million jobs within five years would be formulated which would focus on provision of skills to youth.

He said that the party would promote the manufacturing industry and pave the way for speedy growth of small and medium-sized businesses.

He announced that the goverment's guest houses wold be turned into hotels and made available for the public, and that four new tourist spots would be discovered within the first 100 days.

Transforming Pakistan into a business friendly country, tax reforms and construction of 5 million houses are also among the main points of the proposed 10-point economic policy.

[17-Aug-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> sorry and i quote not 1 million rather 5 MILLION homes *****

[17-Aug-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Imran khan has really worked on social reforms.. he has made a lot of good and effectives policies in Health, education, tourism etc

[17-Aug-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> So i would say EQLI team should definitely look into it

[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> Launch policy framework to build 5 million houses: Launch the Prime Minister’s Housing programme, to build 5 million housing units for the middle and lower income segments in 5 years through the private sector. This will boost industry, create jobs and provide shelter.

Boost the tourism industry: Build framework for private sector investment to develop new and upgrade existing facilities. Initiate conversion of all government guest houses into hotels open to the public. Identify 4 new tourism destinations within the first 100 days for development.

[17-Aug-18 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> He can do it.. He is a sincere person.. He made the first cancer hospital of Pakistan that totally runs on charity and donations, where 70%-80% treatment is FREE OF ANY COST poor and under privileged ( ihave literally seen 6-7 cases myself where they didn't even paid a single penny) . Literally everyone can go to

[17-Aug-18 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> the university of namal where 3 of my friends are graduate from is 75% free. (run on overseas Pakistanis donation and charity)

[17-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Catalyst> there are more than 3 cancer hospitals now, he named it after his mother who died of cancer and he pledged that no mother will die of cancer. Name of the hospital: Shaukat Khanam Memorial cancer hospital.

[17-Aug-18 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
