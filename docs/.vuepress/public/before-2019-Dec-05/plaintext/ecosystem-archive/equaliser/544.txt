[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's been so hot in sydney last week and this week. Sweating a bucket working out outside.

[24-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Doing weights in this heat is hard going

[24-Jan-19 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> no staking but reward contracts should start soon

[24-Jan-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <squintz> That's for the 100k amount right?

[24-Jan-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, looking forward to setting up my rewards and locking my EQLI

[24-Jan-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[24-Jan-19 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <squintz> Risky project. Big dreams and coin is essentially built to sell. No true demand

[24-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> There’s always risk .

[24-Jan-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Buddz1993> Otherwise the gains wouldn’t come 😉

[25-Jan-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Krumlar> HI. I haven't updated my wallet in quite a while (> 4 months).  I understand it was  mandatory to update a little while ago (Komodo) - can this still be done?

[25-Jan-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <AndronicusBass-Founder> I think if you update to latest agama version it should work. Do you have komodo discord server?

[25-Jan-19 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Just update. You’ll be good

[25-Jan-19 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
