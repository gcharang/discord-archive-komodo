[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Nice that we can still group together despite this massive bear market

[07-Feb-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Seems that a lot of micro shit coins are fading into obscurity....but Equaliser has an actual use case, and will run the bear down and come out in the next bull run as a beast.

[dscrdeql] <nille> good day

[07-Feb-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> lol imagine how pissed these sellers are going to be when we hit 200, 400 and even 1000 sats...

[07-Feb-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I think once you've build those first homes, prices can even go a lot higher

[07-Feb-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, look at all off those shitcoins around, no use cases, just money grab projects, and look at what prices some of those coins reach

[07-Feb-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> It's insane how such ''projects'' reach these prices while doing nothing

[07-Feb-19 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Those sellers at these prices don't see that

[07-Feb-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> thats why im loaded up cowboy...im with you!

[dscrdeql] <c2k> looks like one final hurdle near 25sats...and were off to the races

[08-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> thats what Im working on 😄

[08-Feb-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> tryin to sell these last few cars I have on this round so that I can get some more coin and buy up the sellers. It sucks for us as we are short on funding as it is, but nevertheless we are going to be ok.

[08-Feb-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> well if it is alt season that would be cool to catch a few 10x runs lol

[08-Feb-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <c2k> with the $300 rally in BTC today the cost to take that 25sats offer just went from $45 to $42.50...if anyone needs to add to their bag or start their own bag!
:EQLI1: 💯

[08-Feb-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Just a question, but when the reward contracts are activated, are you still thinking of some way to let staking pools use EQLI on their sites to ''stake'' coins or do you want to keep away from that?

[08-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I do get there's trust issues and it's also people's own decision to store coins somewhere, but if reward contracts are able to be hosted per 100k coins on a staking website, it would definitily mean a good advertising spot for EQLI so people get to know more about EQLI's existance

[08-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Or can these staking sites do whatever they want and list coins without the teams wanting them to do so?

[08-Feb-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they dont need permission to do it.

[08-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> they can do it on their own free will, I have actually been talking to the developers at Utrum who have implemented a similar feature called Proof-of-Lock, where it all acts teh same but its done on an API instead of contractually based.

[08-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> example you have 100k coins sitting in your wallet for 90 days. You get rewarded at 90 days, etc etc

[08-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Do you know if some of the staking sites around use fee's to get coins listed like an exchange does? I've seen some staking sites doing it, but I'm not sure if all are doing it

[08-Feb-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I have no idea honestly.

[08-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> back when i was promoting masternodes we used sites like Masternodes.pro

[08-Feb-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> If some of them are free and they are around for quiete some time, it could provide a chance for free advertising about EQLI and I'm sure people would look up on EQLI if they see it getting listed and announced on a staking website

[08-Feb-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I mean, I have some shitcoins on some staking pools and most staking pools often have tons of shitcoins on it, but if they list a new coin, I'm alway's checking it out

[08-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> I know some coins have their own staking service hosted by someone from their own team, which is probably the best you could putt trust in if you're going to buy and stake their coin if you haven't got enough to stake good amounts yourself. But could something similiar be done if there's demand for that in the future?

[08-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> there are many avenues we can pursue when the time comes.

[08-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> I know that isnt exactly what some of you want to hear, but we are working a lot right now.  We will be expanding our team members so that we can get as much done as possible,but for right now we focus on brand and building.

[08-Feb-19 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah I'm glad the building is having all the focus now 😃 I think by the time the first house is ready, people will probably want to join and help out too. It will get things rolling

[08-Feb-19 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Adrian 👽> hallo 😄

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> hi there

[09-Feb-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Yea, looks like all coins have realy gone up a lot today

[09-Feb-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> ahhh. saturday...made great bacon and eggs and lots of black coffee....perfect for the weekend

[09-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> @SwimedDragon Hi there

[09-Feb-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I don't think crypto conditions would need a 'masternode'.

[09-Feb-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> the object of a shared masternode service is for people who don't have enough coin for a masternode themselves.

[09-Feb-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But at current prices 100k EQLI is not too expensive (@20 sats)...maybe $74 USD.

[09-Feb-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> If someone was even remotely interested in investing in Equaliser then I don't think $74 is too much to ask for to get in on the rewards crypto conditions.....hence no real need for a shared 'service'

[09-Feb-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> But if it's just for 'advertising' then yea, doesn't hurt

[09-Feb-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> getting any 'free' advertising is good

[09-Feb-19 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <nille> good day

[09-Feb-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> For now the price is still cheap, but once the first houses are build and news will spread, it will be at a much higher price so eventually I think a lot of people won't be able to get 100k together. We're lucky enough and I hope others know this is a good chance to buy at current prices. Because once we lift off, I doubt we're going to see these prices.
Even if people can buy enough for their own 100k, it's probably easier to send rewards to a shared service so they get additional rewards on it without having another 100k ready

[09-Feb-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> I could see if MN World would be interested in providing shared service for us for the contracts. I'm on the team there so I sometimes have some sway in helping get something listed. I can find out for sure

[09-Feb-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> Also, it is my birthday today xD

[09-Feb-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Combat Wombat> happy birthday Linkara all the best buddy 🎂

[09-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Have a nice birthday Linkara 😄 🍰 🎂

[09-Feb-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> Thanks guys!

[09-Feb-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> How have you two been?

[09-Feb-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Besides a lot of pain in my neck and back, it's going all good. I've been trying to stay away from crypto related news and I haven't regret it yet haha. Prices aren't really moving that much for a while so no need to stay watching it day by day. How are you doing?

[09-Feb-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> I am a little tired from working 9 hours overnight, but doing well! Just ate some breakfast at a restaurant. Free birthday meal heh.

[09-Feb-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Yeah, some restaurants offer that haha, but some are more generous than others. Most of the times when we go out to a restaurant, it's just my son, wife and me. If it's your birthday, you can eat there for free, if you have 3 paying adults along with you...

[09-Feb-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> Interesting lol

[09-Feb-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> I still have to pay taxes and will give a tip too, but I'll take that over the full bill plus the tip. I usually tip better when i get something free like this

[09-Feb-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <Linkara6669-Mod> i have like 5 other free food things i get to use that don't have to be on my birthday, just within a couple/few weeks or within the month

[09-Feb-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> Lol, imagine visiting 10 restaurants in a day because of free meal deals 🤣

[09-Feb-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <SwimedDragon> You're not going to want to eat anything for the next week

[09-Feb-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
