[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> do you mean everyone got levelled down to 1 again

[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> @jellysmash don't know. I have none now

[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and had to start from scratch

[21-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> we all had to start from level 1

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think it was to make everyone equal

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> Really? When was that?

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so we're all on the same page

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> it was about 1.5 weeks ago

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I was on level 15

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> just got there

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and next morning back to level 1

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <sorin90> Is this done frequently?

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> but that's ok

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> no...first time ever

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> I think they did it as part of the new bounty program

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> so that all the new people were the same as everyone else

[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> which I think is good

[21-Aug-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> and good for new people
