[dscrd-hush] <tony> just keep minin

[13-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> well, I stopped mining with GPUs in 2012

[13-May-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> but I mine with asics, fpga's and CPU's

[13-May-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i heard CG has a gpu or 2

[13-May-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I'm finally  firing my GPUs back up next week 😎

[13-May-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ComputerGenie - ChickenPool you can't generate cross platform binaries without the package-lock, and i don't care to explain to you the 999 other reasons what you are suggesting is CG-insanity :carlos:

[13-May-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> there's a reason I've posted exactly 0 pools that run on anything but linux and they've never been tested on anything but debian

[13-May-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> lol

[13-May-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> @tony surviving a bear just means that you have to switch targets; it's financially often better to mine something other than your preference and trade the other thing for it

[13-May-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> _would have done way better mining 3 other coins and trading them for KMD than he did mining KMD_

[13-May-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tony> the thing is i was getting nothing in return from any coin :c and power was way above than the money i was gaining

[13-May-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tony> i think i didnt play my cards right.. if i kept mining i think everything now would be doubled right?

[13-May-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> I wouldn't say "everything", but 2 cents converted to 4 cents is still more profit than 0 cents

[13-May-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <tony> wish i had the money to buy the power 😦 oh well, lets see what happens with hush :p mayhbe a miracle, its the only coin i hold

[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> Today I finally installed HUSHmate and I was amazed how freaking fast that thing got synchronized to 100%. Afterwards I transfered from my old wallet.dat, loaded in the web wallet to a new generated address in my shiny new HUSHmate wallet 😃 and again lightning fast... amazing!  Good job you guys, impressive!

The latest $KMD Agama desktop wallet  0.3.6  supports the latest $HUSH v3 mainnet!
Thanks for all the awesome work by this dedicated team.
It's one of the best multi-coin wallets around, in my humble opinion. https://t.co/zntHAjKSud

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @KayNut that is really nice to hear, thanks!!!

[13-May-19 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that super fast sync is because we got rid of 3GB of chain history, and our chain is very tiny for a little while 😃

[13-May-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> 7,900$ BTC and dominance is 60,5% 😱  ,i wonder when alts start booming

[14-May-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I'm guessing at 65%

[14-May-19 12:57 AM] heguli97#5781
@dxer666 based on your address type(t1) it looks like you're using the old type of address format, new HUSH v3 start with R like komodo addresses. Do you have the latest version of agama wallet(0.3.6) which supports Hushs' new chain?

[14-May-19 12:59 AM] heguli97#5781
If you do, then you need to use the WIF TO WIF converter in agama to change the privatekey format to Komodo's.

[14-May-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> hard to tell if the error is talking about a t1 or R address above

[14-May-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> I can at least tell the address he blurred from the error message starts with t1, 99% certain 🙂

[14-May-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> ok, then it's the correct behavior

[14-May-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> He has an old GUI wallet, which is talking to a new backend. The new backend knows that t1 is not a valid Hush v3 address is and giving a correct error

[14-May-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> our backend electrumX servers have exactly the same IPs and ports, so old GUI wallets will be able to connect but won't work correctly

[14-May-19 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pixelised> Despite some confusion with old Hush addresses and hodlers using old versions of wallets, etc, everything looks to be going well for Hush with new exchanges and new releases of wallets that support :hush_white:  Hush3. There's a Crypto bull run and hopefully Cryptopia open up Hush on their exchange soon... 🚀 🌕

[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we have a nice new QT wallet already, thanks ZecWallet and SevenSeas!

[14-May-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> an added benefit of SilentDragon being a fork of zecwallet is this: Zcash Foundation is funding the development and maintenance of ZecWallet for a while longer, so we get to pull in any of that work that we want, for free basically

[dscrd-hush] <jabe> Have/had most of my Hush on cryptopia as I was never able to withdraw.

[15-May-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> due to them being "In Maintenance"

[15-May-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> I wonder what percentage of total Hush are stuck in cryptopia

[15-May-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> 1200 of mine

[15-May-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> i think about 10%

[15-May-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> that's a lot

[15-May-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jabe> I think they will have to give most of the coins back eventually, could take years though

[15-May-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> like mtgox, years and lawyers will end up with most of it

[15-May-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Kumkani> Does it mean we have lost our coins at cryptopia..?

[15-May-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> no idea what the liquidators will do

[15-May-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> i think it's safe to say many coins will be effectively burnt

[15-May-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Pepin the Healer> e.g. can't withdraw, can't market sell to cover up losses 
good luck explaining to liquidators how to cash in their hush3

[15-May-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I hope the general public understands that the fault lies with Cryptopia and not our team. We are trying our hardest to support the growth of Hush, Cryptopia’s ordeal has not made it easy.
