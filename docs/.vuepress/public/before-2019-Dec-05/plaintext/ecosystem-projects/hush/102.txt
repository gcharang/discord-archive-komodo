[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> yes .. ( I know little about this and my math is not at that level )

[31-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @CHMEX you are right, there is no address data leaking, but there are other unique numbers which metadata analysts can use to figure things out

[31-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <CHMEX> ok

[31-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I highly highly suggest to everyone that they encrypt things inside the encrypted memo field

[31-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Just assume one day, sha256 and zaddrs will be completely broken

[31-May-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> don't put  very important data in there, without "double bagging it"

[31-May-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if you are just sending "Hey i like your blog", then it's not as important, like in chat applications. But for files, they should be encrypted before ever hitting a memo field

[31-May-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some wills might have some public and private data, for instance, a will might have sensitive bank account routing numbers/etc. With HushList, it's possible to make part of your will public, and refer cryptographically to the other part of your will, which is hidden

[31-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> such as "the hash deadbeef represents the sha256 of the hidden part of my will", and you store that in the public will

[31-May-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and then you can make it public one day, and people can verify it's the will you referred to publicly

[31-May-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I plan to have encryption features built into our wallets, so users will be able to encrypt their memos another time, as easily as we can make it

[31-May-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> Let say if I have application Chat A, Application Chat B and Application Group Chat C. 

All connected to Hush blockchain. Now All application are real time. If I send 10000 messages at 0.1 hush total from Chat A. I don't really care if the transaction get confirm or not since Chat B will analyse the mem transaction to insert a message in his node and reply back yes I got it. Chat A use mem pool and will not rebroadcast it. If no response, Chat A will resend the message (with the correct fees) and only then get it accepted. 

How is this type of attack dealt with?

Secondly what stop participants of just cloning hush and creating there own P2P network? Since maybe there find hush price too much and will create a clone with 10x cheaper fees?

[31-May-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ITM> So essential bad actor will only use mem cache transaction and piggy off 10000 nodes for security.

[31-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> morning

[31-May-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <franciscana23> I missed those good rains and airdrops of HUSH 😂 😂

[31-May-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM firstly, these are very good questions and things I think about as well

[31-May-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> !tip @ITM 5 hush

[31-May-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Discordtip> 💸 @dukeleto sent @ITM **5.00 HUSH** (≈ $0.34).

[31-May-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM HushList is a protocol, and any sapling-enabled coin can implement. So if people "clone" Hush or HushList, then we have won, because they are adopting our tech. HushList protocol is like HTTP versus a single website. It's much larger than one blockchain or coin or network. To fully realize it's potential, thousands of networks will have HushList protocol and some will be private + temporary, coming in and out of existence, while others will be public and longer lasting.

[31-May-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In that seething chaos, HUSH+ARRR are (arrr) at the forefront of shielded transaction adoption. I don't see a lot of Zcash protocol coins actually focused on using their shielded addresses, outside of HUSH+ARRR

[31-May-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM your mempool tricks could be seen as a bug or feature

[31-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM and radix42 mentioned those tricks to me, that they were probably possible, about 2 years ago. We considered them  a feature back then

[31-May-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> because it allows you to avoid having to wait 2.5 minutes for a confirmation

[31-May-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM i really like that you are thinking of attack scenarios

[31-May-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @ITM in my original hushlist paper, I described it as a `HushList Protocol: Censorship Resistant Metadata-Minimizing Multi-Blockchain Communication`

[31-May-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> `Multi-Blockchain` is very important, it's not just lip service

[31-May-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If I was a nation state, and I knew that only one blockchain has certain data, then I can block 1 P2P port and that prevents many people from accessing that blockchain in that country

[31-May-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> But if the application can send your data to a random assortment of 1000 blockchains, or however many you want, blocking P2P ports of individual coins is no longer viable. each blockchain is an independent backup of your data

[31-May-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> and different coins are likely to have different node operators, so your data gets spread in different ways geographically, when you spread it across a few chains

[31-May-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> censorship concerns are more important for public data

[31-May-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for private data, you don't really need to worry about all that stuff

[31-May-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> `If I send 10000 messages at 0.1 hush total ....How is this type of attack dealt with?`
I make 10 blocks and take your 0.1 HUSH

[31-May-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> fee=0 xtns still worked on the old Hush v2 network, haven't tried them much on our new mainnet

[31-May-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <ComputerGenie - ChickenPool> likely most clients would ignore them due to relay fee default

[31-May-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @jl777c because logical thinking & ZCash do not go hand in hand :rollsafe:

[31-May-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> In my experience, Zcash is very critical of things coming in from the outside, to the point of making it painful to contribute as a non-ZEC insider. They are allergic to "good enough for now" and always need to reach for Sun, like Icarus

[31-May-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> This comes with a very academic-heavy culture, it makes sense. Zcash culture has a lot of influences from academia and also venture capital-funded corporate culture

[31-May-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> It's an interesting mix for an open source cryptocoin

[31-May-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[31-May-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> we should be able to get a release out pretty soon, i have been using it lately as my GUI HUSH wallet

[31-May-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i like to find bugs myself, and the only real way to do that is use it for real-life tasks and see what smoke comes out

[31-May-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> it actually helped me test stuff for James before, otherwise it would have taken me longer to type on the CLI. It's nice to be able to choose a GUI wallet, when I want it 😃

[31-May-19 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that is what the UI looks like, it's pretty nice

[31-May-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> mining to a shielded address increases YOUR OWN privacy drastically, by leaving much less metadata on-chain

[31-May-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> additionally, it helps the privacy of EVERYBODY because it increases the amount of funds and transactions in the "shielded pool" (the set of all funds in zaddrs), which makes blockchain analysis a lot harder

[31-May-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <webworker01 - MinerPond.com> @dukeleto I sent miningpoolstats a msg about it

[31-May-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
