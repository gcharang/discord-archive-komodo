[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I cross posted to our Reddit channels 😃

[28-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <StudHeckerte> Where is the best place to get official news for Hush? Been holding this since 2$ :(

[28-Aug-18 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> yes, Berg has been doing a great job getting important updates out on Twitter

[28-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <rikst> I think we need to update Hush website also: to add brief info why Hush is better than other alts. May be to make the table with comparisons. Just to make it easy for understanding for potential investors.

[28-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I agree that a comparison table between currencies be created. We could circulate it on the Discord, bitcointalk and on Twitter but not on the HUSH official website. This only my personal opinion of course.

[28-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I like how BTCH has that table, but I'm also not positive about displaying it on the website, I agree with gilardh about circulating it on social media, but not including it on the website.

[28-Aug-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Taking shots at other coins on our website, which should be mostly informative, doesn't seem like the best practice.

[28-Aug-18 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I would agree with it for marketing though 😃

[28-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Funny how well CNBC works as a contra-indicator to crypto markets

[28-Aug-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> They came out with this extremely uninformed segment last night featuring Jordan Belfort & Roger Ver (two of the slimiest people) & now people are looking at crypto again

[28-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> Do I think this is the start of a bull run? No, probably not. But its hilarious how whenever cnbc calls "doomsday" on crypto people start to buy it lmao

[28-Aug-18 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I was wondering what was up with the price.

[28-Aug-18 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> My real question is whether or not to sell my BTC at $7K and buy back in once it inevitably tests 6 again

[28-Aug-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Is it strange that I get more stressed out when the prices start rising than when the market is bleeding?

[28-Aug-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Like I haven't accumulated enough, bull run needs to wait 😉

[28-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Hehe, same here.

[28-Aug-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <daanoontjeh> Holding the FOMO, a retest will happen.

[28-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> @Berg may be safer to divest in some alt positions in this small run if you can make some BTC and just HODL for dear life

[28-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <RunningMantheCoin> #nothushtho

[28-Aug-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I'm personally just a holder at this point

[28-Aug-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I used to play the divest invest game while at a loss, but at this point I like my portfolio a whole bunch, and I would feel awful divesting something just for it to hit it's stroke.

[28-Aug-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @Berg i am fine with you modifying either Hush/BTCH websites however you think best. The BTCH website was created at a time of great drama when we had to easily show/prove that we had better features than similar competitors. I think the future of BTCH is all about making it interesting to mine and also cryptoconditions, less about the stuff in that table

[28-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> What problem is it solving?

[28-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> Tell people how they can use it

[28-Aug-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> And by when

[28-Aug-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @dukeleto I wasn't a proponent of taking down the BTCH table, I see how it benefits being able to tell BTCH apart from BTCP and the billion other clones.

[28-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I just don't know how on-board I'd be with making a similar one for Hush.

[dscrd-hush] <StudHeckerte> @daanoontjeh thanks for the info

[29-Aug-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <StudHeckerte> Can/should someone moderate Reddit? I noticed one or the most recent posts there is an Ad to buy "cheap Z9s"...

[29-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Yeah, I don't think anyone current has Reddit mod permissions

[29-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But we definitely should have someone cleaning it up.

[29-Aug-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Bithorny> anyone knows what happened to btchush?

[29-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTCH has been receiving upgrades from Komodo, as it is a runtime fork.

[29-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Marketing is going to be returning to BTCH as well as some new modifications to algo and supply and whatnot.

[29-Aug-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you care to read up in #btch there's been some public discussion about it

[29-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Would people rather mine BTCH with any recent CPU on the planet, or with newer fancy ASICs like the z9 and z9 mini? Discuss.

[29-Aug-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> They are two very different paths

[29-Aug-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I personally believe that CPU ASIC resistance is the best yet, because it doesn't favor either of those two battling parties.
I'm still pretty on the fence between the two though, I'd like to see what the community has to say about it.

[29-Aug-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Question that I ask:
- How many CPUs in circulation against how many ASICs?
- What is the distribution / terrestrial distribution rate of CPUs compared to ASIC?
- Which one is the least dedicated to a single task between the CPU and the ASIC?
- What would be the best distribution / distribution for Block Reward, CPU or ASIC?

[29-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Only Asic resistance will be better. POW/POS 50/50 like a veruscoin is very best decision

[29-Aug-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> This is a good consensus giving the opportunity to earn coin holders and simple home miners, excluding large farms (there are many large not only ASIC farms but also GPUs)

[29-Aug-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I do agree that Verushash would really set BTCH apart from other Bitclones

[29-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> BTCH will become a unique coin in the ranks of countless clones (BTCP, BTG, Bitcoin green, bitcoin interest)
None of them offers such a good fair option for ordinary people. You can say it can become a people's coin for people)

[29-Aug-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <KayNut> ASIC mining makes BTCH an exclusive coin for people that can, and are willing, to pay for ASIC miners. Whereas CPU mining makes it possible for the average Joe (me) to get some coins at small cost (electricity is expensive in germany). It (CPU mining) also would be a small step in mass adoption .

[29-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> You are right. In European countries, electricity is expensive and there are few miners. Basically Asia, Russia, former socialist countries, and countries where cheap electricity. Our version is suitable for everyone. For people with any financial means and region of residence.

[29-Aug-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> I also feel that VerusHash is more "fair" in that more people in the world already have CPUs that can mine it, and they are the cheapest way to mine versus GPU + ASIC, which require larger up-front investments. It allows old computers to be "up-cycled", all of a sudden an old dusty computer  can generate some funds. It also allows people in areas with no access to GPU cards or ASICs (a lot of people) to be able to mine the same way as everybody else. Equal access mining I guess.

[29-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> in theory the lead dev of Verus will send in a PR that will allow new KMD asset chains to choose VerusHash

[29-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> when that happens, we can then use that option when we make the new BTCH chain

[29-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> If BTCH becomes VerusHash 50/50, it will be very similar to Verus, in terms of the tech insides. Something to consider when thinking about marketing + differentiating the coins

[29-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> Then even someone with very little funds could go to a second hand store, buy a 20$ desktop an possibly make a profit.

[29-Aug-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the best scenario is repurposing existing computers to mine on a few cores, if they aren't using them all, or buying computers there are very cheap from a few years ago

[29-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> for instance, mining on the very newest computers with VerusHash gives you a higher mining rate, but your cost per H/s is higher, because new hardware has a high premium

[29-Aug-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the CPUs need to be made in the last ~5 years to effectively mine VerusHash, older computers will be able to do very slowly

[29-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> core i5's and newer are good, it's all about having certain CPU instructions (AES, AVX, and friends)

[29-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> the more fast instructions your CPU has, and the faster they are, the better your hashrate

[29-Aug-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if the CPU doesn't have them, verushash will still work but it doesn't make sense financially to mine in that situation

[29-Aug-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> AMD + Intel CPU's work, in case that wasn't clear, anything reasonably new

[29-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> i guess we can estimate the future mining potential of CPUs on BTCH by looking at Verus hashrates

[29-Aug-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> conveniently, the Verus Discord has a channel just for that #cpu-hashrate

[29-Aug-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> so look up your CPU version, and search for it in that channel to see other peoples speeds

[29-Aug-18 07:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> that will let you say "which of these 2 CPU's would be better at mining BTCH?" if you wanted to ask such a question.

[29-Aug-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> If you'd like to go check out hash rates:
https://discord.gg/jXFvm8p

[29-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @dukeleto And how can you make it so that BTCH takes experience from Veruscoin, without becoming like him? Can you add  special thing, how can you modernize it?

[29-Aug-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> very good question

[29-Aug-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> What usually attracts people first? In most cases, the opportunity to earn, get a bonus. The success of Veruscoin was that at the very beginning people had the opportunity to get coins in large quantities with little CPU power or the number of coins in the wallet, provided that the coin is strictly limited in quantity.
I would call it democratic

[29-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> For example, can I make a CPU power limit? Or a limit on the maximum number of coins for POS mining, so as to exclude large players altogether? Socialism in Crypto

[29-Aug-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Now I see that the complexity of Veruscoin's network has greatly increased compared to when it started. Is it possible to do so that the interest was much longer. Perhaps this is a stupid question, just a reflection

[30-Aug-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Some people remark that very early Verus investors staked a huge amount of coins, which pale in comparison to what you can mine now, if you read their #mining channel discord from today.

[30-Aug-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> The reason BTCH is considering PoS is to give something to current BTCH HODLers, to compensate for increasing supply and diluting the % of total supply that you own. The intent is to level the playing field between benefiting current HODLers and future miners. There doesn't seem to be a consensus about anything, just talking about options

[30-Aug-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> if we did, we would be using the builtin -ac_stake options to Komodo, where we can define the % of blocks that are PoS, so it could 50 or whatever we decide
