[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> now I import the key?

[06-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> New wallet, no transactions... so you’ll need to import the key indeed

[06-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> I didn't know KMD hacked itself.

[06-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> So is it important to save the keys + wallet.dat for each coin? I always thought it was enough to save the Agama wallet seed

[06-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Better safe than sorry... Digital storage may become corrupt. Personally I have all my WIFs and seeds on paper in my safe.

[06-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And of coarse daily backups of my wallet.dat files

[06-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Wow, daily

[06-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Good to learn all this to be extra safe

[06-Jun-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I’m ‘*slighlty*’ paranoid in that respect, but I scheduled a task, so why not daily....

[06-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dΛtmox> if ure that paranoid don't give away too much info on your security 😛

[06-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My backup doesn’t do just a copy.... it encrypts too... so if anybody gets his hands on the backups, they’ll first have to decrypt them, among other things....

[06-Jun-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But that’s all useless if somebody gains access to the live wallet.dat

[06-Jun-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And I'm not afraid to share general security procedures.

[06-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @dΛtmox - that would be security through obscurity then

[06-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and thats almost always very bad practice 😉

[06-Jun-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> @Oink Have you ever heard the saying "It is always better to err on the side of paranoia.."?

[06-Jun-19 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Infinit0 QR code of your private key tattoo hidden under your hair might be safe enough? Unless that person goes bald 😆

[06-Jun-19 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Infinit0 laminated paper delaminates when exposed to moist over long periods of time, especially if the laminated layers are stressed, like when rolling up..., tin cans tend to rot away over time... anyone with an RFID reader can get a signal on the gps trackers... but wouldn’t any signal be blocked by the tin can (Faradays cage)

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> So..

[07-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Is their a way to create a privacy coin, without exploits, by limiting the design? This includes any aspect of the coin--wallets, etc....

[07-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This isn't a criticism bc of recent events...
It just seems like widespread adoption requires a privacy project, to open itself up more to exploits..

[07-Jun-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) not sure what you mean... we have been devoid of exploits so far, while we know that it is a risk for any project whatsoever, we work hard to stay on top of things and to respond quickly if something is ever discovered. We also use and develop leading solutions to help keep it that way. do you have any particular exploit you're concerned about? are you referring to the one that hit Komodo Agama but not Verus Agama? Earlier Zcash sprout issues that we fixed before anyone else besides Zcash, or the 51% attacks that Verus is resistant to in multiple ways? Maybe fake stake or nothing at stake attacks that we have solutions for? Please let us know if there's a kind of exploit you feel would be something we need to look into related to our privacy capability or the zero knowledge support on PBaaS chains. I'm not aware of any weakness in those areas regarding Verus, but we are always looking 😃

[07-Jun-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Mike, I never said anything of the sort.
It wasn't directed towards any project.
It was a general question, in general discussion.

I know, that projects like XMR & not until of very recent ZEC, had a mobile wallet. 
Why that is, I'm not one hundred percent sure.
I'm not an expert, nor am I a developer.
But it does seem that, in most things privacy tech related, that less can be better.

[07-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This is a general privacy tech related comment, not directed at Verus, or Komodo or any privacy project.

[07-Jun-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> ___
I did find myself thinking about PBaaS & if it would be possible, to add another level of privacy, to a chain... Not that Verus doesn't offer the Gold Standard, in crypto... It was just a thought

[07-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> so can i just use my existing verus address and send kmd stuff to them?

[07-Jun-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> why do i need to generate a new address?

[07-Jun-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> if your verus address has never been used in the affected agama wallet, then it's fine @Akira X

[07-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) There's an Albert Einstein quote, "things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler", that I think applies. There are many things to achieve with blockchain, and if it is pure privacy and sending of amounts only, you can achieve that most simply without other core capabilities. When you start to want other capabilities, like dapps, or staking, or cross-chain operations, or other advanced features, a provably private system may require more complexity, but it should still be kept as simple as possible, I believe. I don't think that means open to more exploits, but I may misunderstand what you mean.

[07-Jun-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> No, you understood me correctly.

[07-Jun-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Akira X there is an update w/ more coins and K64 support on the way, though it should work now. The only wallet that could have compromised an address that would have been used with it is desktop Komodo Agama wallet from the last few months. Mobile wallets don’t have the issue, and neither does Verus Agama desktop. You might already know that, but just for clarity.

[07-Jun-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> the fact that Verus vs of Agama was ano affected is because you decided not to use npm's or just by accident? :smiley_abused:
