There is one wat you can make more money than Crypto when  it goes stream! and  its having the best domains big companies will buy from you!   but they are all gone.  Check  it out!  googlecoin.com,  facebookcoin.com ,  HSBCcoin.com. Check all the banks, airliines, superstore, anything that is big companies, and add coin at the end of their domain,  You will not find anything,  they are all taken,  The owners of thses domains will be millionaires

[16-Jan-19 04:22 PM] MR_President#6999
I bought some of the best ones in the year 2013

[16-Jan-19 04:23 PM] MR_President#6999
I got one that is the best of all!! and when  they asked me for it I will ask $30 millions

[16-Jan-19 04:24 PM] MR_President#6999

Just to let you know as soon I  get a bit rich I will start building the bus for real, without money I can not do much with this bear market

But I will

[15-Mar-19 11:11 AM] MR_President#6999
My philosophy “more work and less speak”  we cannot  speak with something to talk about , not like 90 per cent of project that all they do is talk and taking the money from people and will never deliver anything !I will never talk when I dont have the funds to build the bus, So I am patient and will not take money from not one and deliver nothing, I m the opposite, one day I will  be rich and will build the bus with the help of some appreciated friends from Komodo Community but till then I will not bother you and let you do what you love more , in the meantime I am working working in preparing things once I have the funds, You will see the Future with me, and Roberto will see the past with Cleopatra 😃

I know there is a list of people who are eager to be Transpotimers, but to be a real Transpotimer, you need to believe in this project, be active and not just wait to get on the bus without contributing anything to deserve it. Only a few people on that list will get onto the bus as you need to prove that you are dignified enough to be called a Transpotimer.

[11-Sep-19 10:34 PM] MR_President#6999
Perhaps sooner than later and it could happen than the bus will travel from the future to the present day before the bus was built, thats a possibility, because this project  exist, think about it,the genuine project with a strong heart existence means that it has the potential to affect the future without even being built yet but to be seen, detected in some way even if not already detected now but in the future to come back to us for some  paradox reason, and there we will see the real transpotimers coming off the bus

[11-Sep-19 10:39 PM] MR_President#6999
I have done all I could to make that paradox a reality , I can not do more, now let the future decide the present, my intelligence and good  will have reached its  top level. the level destiny has decided for me to reach. Alone can not do more

[11-Sep-19 10:50 PM] MR_President#6999
How many project have disappered collecting money from ICO...90 per cent? all these  call potencial projects never started anything with all the money they collected NOTHING!! WLC project did not collect any money no a single dollar and  we are still here alive and you can call us crazy and whatever but  no deceivers and scammers like those 90  per cent of projects that run away with your money!  All I did was to start and not to end....I will never end because Tranpotime21bus will never let the end ever to end!

Once we reach the future, i have a great feeling that we will learn what is needed to make a visit to the past. At this point, going to the past seems to be a myth but going to the future was a supposed myth many years ago until now where it is extremely possible from many collected physicists minds. Looking forward to what the future will bring to this grande project that is wlc and its success! 🙂

WLC token swap to replace lost exchange tokens while being delisted ( Estimated was 20 millions WLC)

We are pleased to announce that we are taking positive steps to resolve this issue and that we will be working with Komodo to resolve the situation. On Friday 1st November, we will have a new chain and provide a 10:1 token swap to all existing holders.  Old supply 210 millions , New Supply 21 millions. 

Failure to comply will result in the said tokens being lost without any SWAP.

Please join WLC channel in the Komodo  Discord as we will manage the swap there.

Please note the swap process will be open for a maximum of 4 weeks. So you must have this completed in advance of the 30th November 2019.

Further instructions will be given Friday 1st November.

As you know there will be two buses, The reason for the two buses is so that one could be used as backup if the need to rescue the first bus in the past or the future arises, So we need two teams I can trust..so the driver of the other bus has to be of my entire trust, @metaphilibert  you will be the driver of the other bus, you can chose the members of the team, conditon to tavel in the bus has to have done something for the project and at the time of travelling needs to have 30K WLC21 in their wallet so we know are real fans and supporter of the project, there will have to be people in the Komodo community, so half of the team will be in one bus and the other half will be in the other bus, @Madmats you are in my team and will be the co-pilot of the Bus ( second driver and second in command) you are in my team and @Alice  and @ca333  in my team too, @kolo and @phm87 will be in @metaphilibert  I don't want perberts  in my bus lol.  Please no porno stars in the bus, we will have plenty of sex with ancient and slaves women in the past, and with robot women in the future,  metaphilibert you chose your team but will only 11 members as 10 will have to be specialists. Professor will be also in my bus,  Academy partner of Professor will be in Metaphilibert bus

[17-Nov-19 07:31 AM] MR_President#6999
I know there are a list of 24 transpotimer than register in 2017 but you can not get in the bus without moving a finger for the project , it would not be fair and will damage the project

Here is the reason why the below transpotimer in my bus are worth to be in my bus, Metaphilibert will give the reason for his bus members:

1)Madmats ------> Roberto Team why? my left hand full support and looking after the media all the time, very active

2)CA333 ------> Roberto Team Bus, why? provided full support and provided a key elememt to the project

3)Alice ------> Roberto Team Bus why? provied full support and created a video for us

4)House ------> Roberto Team Bus why? provied full support and let me write in his magazine 3 years ago where the idea of transpotime21bus was born


5)Artik123 ------> Roberto Team bus why? provided full support, created a real logo and hanging down on his wall, also he offered something very nice to the project I couldnt accept


6)Yassinkomodo ------> Roberto Team Bus why? provided full support and twitter our project and he was a great friend in bad times


7)Shossain ------> Roberto Team bus why? Provided full support and father of WLC21

Metaphilibert is a great man and full support from the beggining and is a person I can put my life on his hands thats why he is the commander of the other bus ad he will have to provide also a reason why the people on his list are worth to be called transpotimer and  to have a ticket for the bus

are you serious about the time travelling buses ? are they completed or it's just a joke to make people laugh ?

[21-Nov-19 07:31 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Questions like "is it already built" is always difficult to answer when talking about time travel machines 
Paradox and all you know 😁

[21-Nov-19 07:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Of course it is serious, how can you doubt?

[21-Nov-19 07:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Seriously?

[21-Nov-19 07:42 PM] PHBA2061#2530
so it is already built ? the 2 busses ?
I meant it was already built, or it will be built in the future & someone from the future did travel back using the bus & confirm it will be built
I'm also interested in space-time travelling & have a few questions to ask, if this project is serious.

or if the busses aren't being built yet, then what is the current progress on the theory research ?

@PHBA2061 my question to you is the following, how many projects have  completed or deliverved anything? How many of them is  a joke? I guess 95 per cent of them as they took your money and run away with it without even starting!  those are the real jokers! We are very serious and I have a team who is loyal to this project and above all decent! we started 2017 and we are evolving and still here not collecting a single penny and still here after 3 years...we will build the bus for sure, we need funds, we have a great professor and as soon we have the funds we will fund him to build the time machine and at the same time building the two buses structures! we are not a joke, we are still here...the jokes are the one we all sponsored and run away with our money. We will build it!
