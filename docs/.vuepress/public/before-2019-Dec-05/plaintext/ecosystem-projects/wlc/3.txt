Our project is different, not boring , no doing the same staff as all project out there, most will fail as they dont have imagination or ideas. just only to create a project to make money without personality! My team have a personality, real transpotimers who did something for the project.

[22-Nov-19 07:12 PM] MR_President#6999
We did a free ICO not taking money! that is decency!

[22-Nov-19 07:14 PM] MR_President#6999
We are not here for the money, we are here to build a bus time machine! Look all the project ouit there...how many coins they keep for themselves 85 per cent or more?

[22-Nov-19 07:19 PM] MR_President#6999
We have delivered free to the community more than half...and the team dont have much more than anyone who got free wlc, the same with me I have less  than 5 per cent. I have worked my bollets on this and spent a lot of money from my own pocket making aware of this project

[22-Nov-19 07:21 PM] MR_President#6999
The roadmap will be publish in December

[22-Nov-19 07:24 PM] MR_President#6999
We dont want transpotimers who only want to have popcorns in the bus, we want real transpotimers, real beleivers who do something for the project, I want peace and harmony in all we do, we are doing things and at the monent we are doing a swap to have a better coin where you can mine it and stalk it with a new algo

well I'm only interested in the theory part of time travelling, that's what I'm asking, I don't really care about how the coins are distributed though
> how many projects have  completed or deliverved anything? How many of them is  a joke?
I agree most of them are
> Our project is different, not boring , no doing the same staff as all project out there
I'm sorry, no offense, but that's what said by the others 95% projects too 😅 
> We are very serious...we started 2017 and we are evolving
Then what were your team progress on theoretical research during the past 2 years ? That's what I'm interested in, please answer straight into my question.

[22-Nov-19 09:48 PM] MR_President#6999
As I said all will be reveal beginning of December so its only less than 10 days , it will be very specific , you will have all the details there

[22-Nov-19 10:40 PM] PHBA2061#2530
ok I'll wait till December 1st then.
But if it doesn't answer my question, then I'll keep asking.

[22-Nov-19 11:10 PM] MR_President#6999
keep asking all you want, we are in a time loop 🙂

[25-Nov-19 07:10 AM] MR_President#6999
Only 5 days left for the swap, if you don't swap your WLC for WLC21 you lost them

[25-Nov-19 04:27 PM] cascrypto#8206
first chain on KMD you do not want to miss thiss, is their contact with all first 21 timetravelers? lootz, house and the core team?

[25-Nov-19 07:16 PM] metaphilibert#0926
House is in Mr President's bus, will ask other to be part of mine 😉

[25-Nov-19 07:16 PM] metaphilibert#0926
It will be the funniest bus I promise 😁

[25-Nov-19 08:44 PM] MR_President#6999
@metaphilibert remember noone will be in anybus if they have not contributed in anything in this project

[25-Nov-19 08:46 PM] MR_President#6999
whoever is in your bus you will have to describe what they have done like I have done in my list. We dont want parasits, we want real transpotimers

I am seeing in 4D Mr President and maybe some that did not contributed yet will be in future

[25-Nov-19 09:32 PM] metaphilibert#0926
But I got your point Mr President

[26-Nov-19 08:27 AM] MR_President#6999
My point is I know we have been too generous, kind and of course too naive for being extremely good to the rotten ones, I have seen who sold all their WLC that was given for free ,its good you sell and trade but sell all and then do or say bad things a I will not tolerate those to be in the bus, we have been treated unfairly and know who they are  . they will be hunted by karma in their life. Life is not free for their actions, you do wrong you will pay your wrong, if you live with no morals you live without a soul and all your friends will be just non existence as sooner or later will know the kind of person they are behind the mask

[26-Nov-19 08:44 AM] PHBA2061#2530
if you made WLC a minable coin, with no premine, and reasonable emission curve, then that wouldn't happen

[26-Nov-19 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
premine is there to airdrop the coins to existing holders at 10:1

[26-Nov-19 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
rest of them are minable

[26-Nov-19 03:25 PM] SHossain#0007
and stakeable

[26-Nov-19 03:41 PM] PHBA2061#2530
I refer to WLC, not WLC21

[26-Nov-19 03:42 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...WLC

[26-Nov-19 03:43 PM] SHossain#0007
that was early time...and mining wasn't available for smart chains if i remember correctly

in the last few years, a lot of things updated, created, integrated into komodo source

[26-Nov-19 03:44 PM] SHossain#0007
first was `on-demand` chains, then `minable`, then `staking`, then `CC/Antara Framework`...

[26-Nov-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
and, the development continues

[26-Nov-19 03:49 PM] PHBA2061#2530
interesting, I didn't know that

[28-Nov-19 09:18 PM] metaphilibert#0926
To be exact they were minable but with a ridiculous block reward (like DEX OR SUPERNET)

[28-Nov-19 09:19 PM] SHossain#0007
still, `on-demand` 😛

Or a bus

[28-Nov-19 09:20 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Also when preparing PR a second electrum node could be convenient

[28-Nov-19 09:20 PM] metaphilibert#0926
A volunteer in the room?
@phm87

[28-Nov-19 09:21 PM] phm87#7395
I've never played with electrum but having one or two electrums servers can be good for atomicdex

[28-Nov-19 09:21 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I think there will be an update soon for agama so don't need to rush and with one electrum it is OK

[28-Nov-19 09:21 PM] metaphilibert#0926
But let's think about it for the update after

[28-Nov-19 09:22 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Ah phm it is very easy
You need a node with wlc21 running and launch a quite light electrum service

[28-Nov-19 09:22 PM] phm87#7395
if you have a tutorial, I can try to learn to run electrum servers but I know nearly nothing about electrum now

[28-Nov-19 09:22 PM] metaphilibert#0926
I can point you to easy guides for it

[28-Nov-19 09:23 PM] metaphilibert#0926

Good job Transpotimers, @metaphilibert I did provide you with transparent logo

[29-Nov-19 09:19 AM] MR_President#6999
Perhaps because is transparent you couldnt see it 🙂

[30-Nov-19 10:05 AM] MR_President#6999
Thats good then you will get your new WLC21 after today nobody will get it, we gave 2 month notice. But we will do something extraordinary

[30-Nov-19 10:07 AM] MR_President#6999
If you sent it before 30th November ends you will get your WLC21  https://wlc.kmdexplorer.io/address/RAQty3BAGvMp4fi46QU2uTJozutYSbXeX5

[01-Dec-19 08:57 AM] MR_President#6999
The swap has ended please do not send more WLC as you will not get anything . We have given 2 month notice.

[02-Dec-19 07:22 AM] Mark81#4505
Well that was all i got so really cant send more.

[02-Dec-19 07:26 AM] Mark81#4505
Now I will wait your projects succeed and will buy ticjet to your bus with kmd to go back and tell my self yo do that in time.

[02-Dec-19 09:14 AM] PHBA2061#2530
so when exactly the specific details about everything will be revealed MR_President ? at the beginning of December presumely

[02-Dec-19 10:02 AM] MR_President#6999
@Mark81 glad to see you here Mark, long time I dont see you, one of our main defenders when we used to be in bitcointalk 🙂 all the trolls we had to confront! Bitcointalk was that for every project

I've been here lurking and didnt sell any of the wlc what you gave back in time. Sorry for that didn't swap in time. It was on my mind but last week time just flied and after i realized what mock up i did..  well you know yhe rest. Well i am just glad to see wlc is back up again after that cryptopia fiasco.

[02-Dec-19 10:09 AM] MR_President#6999
@Mark81  did you send yours WLC to this address RAQty3BAGvMp4fi46QU2uTJozutYSbXeX5 as per migration instructions?

A quote from the video:
> We are not a castle in the air type of project. This is not a project that has no realistic goals.
Well among all things, time travelling is 1 of the most unrealistic ever ...
I'll be waiting for the publication of your scientific papers, research results & documented videos then, as stated in the video.

[02-Dec-19 10:43 AM] MR_President#6999
everything is unrealistic till it happens! You can tell how unrealistic was Jules Verne but now all he wrote is very realistic.   Time travel is not real now but will be tomorrow

[02-Dec-19 11:16 AM] PHBA2061#2530
it's a bad comparison & Jules Verne's novel has nothing to do with time travel, deep-sea creatures & time travelling are not the same thing ... What makes time travel practically impossible for humans is the acceleration to nearly the speed of light has to be done slowly, otherwise instant acceleration to the speed of light would crush time-travellers by their own weight, but slow acceleration means you need a lot of energy to achieve the speed of light.

[02-Dec-19 11:27 AM] MR_President#6999
If you want to argue for the sake of arguing will not lead anywhere, I did not say he has something to do with time travel, what I said what he wrote in his book was unrealistic on his time but its not anymore now. The same with time travel now is unrealistic but tomorrow will not as we will have the tools to make it a reality, Don't manipulate my words. Travelling to the moon was unrealistic then but not anymore. Time travel is unrealistc now but tomorrow not anymore , its a matter of time, as science progressing so the possibility of travelling in time

[02-Dec-19 11:44 AM] PHBA2061#2530
> The same with time travel now is unrealistic but tomorrow will not. Time travel is unrealistc now but tomorrow not anymore , its a matter of time, as science progressing so the possibility of travelling in time
I'm arguing because your comparisons are off. Just because travelling to the space, or deep-sea diving was not doable in the past, it is now doable, doesn't imply that time travelling will be possible in the future (btw this is what people call "hasty generalization", or "over-extension", a type of informal fallacy). 
> Don't manipulate my words
Lol I just quote what you said 😅 
And yes arguing with me will lead to nowhere, just show me the scientific papers, research results & documented videos, I'll be patiently waiting.
But I see no scientific paper, research result & documented video published so far, so there isn't any progress during the past 2 years since the coin was created ?

[02-Dec-19 12:24 PM] MR_President#6999
You dont make any sense, when you want to contribute instead of annoying will do much better to anyone around you

[02-Dec-19 12:35 PM] PHBA2061#2530
> You dont make any sense
Please point out what didn't make sense ...
> when you want to contribute instead of annoying
I was pointing out what is off with your comparison (it's up to you to acknowledge it or not), and asking a legit question on the progress of scientific papers, research results & documented videos. Is that considering annoying people ?

[02-Dec-19 12:57 PM] MR_President#6999
I am familiarizing myself with your personality, I am minding my body language to protect my energy and focusing into good things, I did answer your question and you still in the same loop of comparition, I will not let anyone to drain my energy into stupidity discussion or raise my ire by limiting the amount of time spent in your loop, its pointless, loops are endless circle, you are invited to stay there, I have better things to do that spinning around the same thing.  ...only you set a time limit..where you want to go not only with your body but with your mind...Cleopatra is waiting for me in her milky bath..

[02-Dec-19 01:07 PM] PHBA2061#2530
lol I can't tell if you're being serious ...
> I will not let anyone to drain my energy into stupidity discussion.
Again, I was asking what did I say that doesn't make sense, or stupid, I'll kindly explain
> I did answer your question and you still in the same loop of comparition
where did you answer my question ? I was asking a question on the progress of scientific papers, research results & documented videos (or any progress during the past 2 years), and where could I find them if there is any. 
You are just avoiding my questions ...

[02-Dec-19 01:12 PM] MR_President#6999
the answer is in the video if you listen to it with attention.

[02-Dec-19 01:21 PM] PHBA2061#2530
lol why don't you just answer my question directly, I'm asking  if there is any scientific paper, research result or documented video published yet ? in the video it just mention that there will be scientific papers, research results or documented videos published. 
So I assume no scientific paper, research result or documented video has been published so far ? ok I'll be waiting for them to be published & peer reviewed

[02-Dec-19 01:24 PM] MR_President#6999
You answer your own question, all you did have to do is getting out of your own loop 🙂

[02-Dec-19 01:31 PM] PHBA2061#2530
yeah same to you, if you could get out of your own loop & gave me the answer directly then I wouldn't ask the same question again & again & wasting time ...

[02-Dec-19 01:45 PM] MR_President#6999
By developing consistent positive behaviour towards a negative behaviour I made   you to learn the answer without me  to tell you vervally...There is a big difference between you and me, You wasted your time, and me I stop wasting my time 🙂

[02-Dec-19 02:39 PM] PHBA2061#2530
we could have both save a lot of time if you just answered the question directly ... sigh

[02-Dec-19 10:00 PM] MR_President#6999
All question can be answer when they are done with good faith and spirit....The bus will be built  as soon as we get the  funds for it and as result only reports can ne done if thats the case...all takes time and more when we are project with rely on  honesty and not stealing money from  anyone...I believe in Karma and as such we will survive if we do everything with honesty....what we have done the last two years ..to survive and be alive before get  a much better website and a new air. We have been let down by many and many others has kept the project alive thanks to kind people.....I have been offered money as a gift for the project and I did not accept not just $10K but $40K before the bum of 2017 a very good spirit...this is the kind of people who make a good transpotimer! no the one who sell all his wlc at the first chance to get $100  and shit on us.... I will not take money from not one. not even from angels.......we will only use the funds we have once we get it trading and deliver to buy a bus and for professor to get what he needs....all that is said in the video roadmap...we said : WILL have reports, no that we HAD reports or if We had done something .....We have the ideas and principles how to start the investigation and experiments....you can not do that without money.....Only good spirits can bring this project to a good end...I am trying to get it to an exchange......... A good person who blindly wanted to be a Transpotimer  is making it possible to trade in atomidex, another one very kind heart made the new WLC21 with the help of another nice man! they did not ask for anything ...while others sold all their WLC and did nothing for this project....I like to live with my conscious clean and I will build the bus.. we will build the bus

[02-Dec-19 10:22 PM] PHBA2061#2530
> We have the ideas and principles how to start the investigation and experiments
do you mind elaborating on your ideas & principles, like you're going to time-travel based on what principles ? Travel at the speed of light ?

[02-Dec-19 10:24 PM] MR_President#6999

quantum physic, astro-physic, free energy, quantum gravity, wormhole ... it's just a bunch of jargon putting together
the answer I'm looking for is for example how are you going to locate the wormhole if there is any, once enter the wormhole how passengers on the bus can sustain the acceleration from the wormhole, may be the questions are too specific, I'll be waiting  for the papers & experimental results to be released

[03-Dec-19 09:05 AM] MR_President#6999
all exchange ask above $10K hahaha I remember Iwhen we put WLC in Cryptopia for $1000 lol that was old times.  We have to bet for the future decentralised exchanges safer and the Future. Cryptopia was hacked... Its stupid to pay that amount of money and then get hacked...we are not in a hurry we have the time in our hands
