Does it just randomly select the 50 users to rain the ARRR onto?

[29-Oct-18 08:50 PM] yorktronic#2703
I am against

[29-Oct-18 08:54 PM] yorktronic#2703
More specifically, I am against for the reasons Zooko has provided in support of pursuing ASIC-resistance

[29-Oct-18 08:54 PM] yorktronic#2703
such as: "I often think of my 14yo son, who used to mine Zcash on his gaming rig (when he wasn’t playing Fortnite PugBee). I think it would be really great if Zcash could be more accessible to more 14yo gamers. Also Venezuelans, who sometimes mine cryptocurrencies on their GPUs"

Future of Zcash mining (circa 2019 and 2020)
Folks: after extensive study, consultation with other people in the industry, and public discussion on this forum and many other places, the Zcash Company has decided we’ll support a new version of our zcashd software which implements changes to mining.  When?  Nothing will...

[29-Oct-18 08:54 PM] yorktronic#2703
that's basically a handful of red herrings

[29-Oct-18 08:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
let them make it asic resistant, more hashrate for other equihash coins.

[29-Oct-18 08:58 PM] yorktronic#2703
if the ZEC equihash hashrate is distributed among the remaining equihash coins after ZEC forks to be asic-resistance, difficulty will scyrocket across the board. Unless price follows that difficulty spike, it's going to screw with every Equihash coin out there.

[29-Oct-18 08:59 PM] actionslacks#4072
you could be right,

[29-Oct-18 09:00 PM] yorktronic#2703
ZEC's nethash is greater than the sum of all other Equihash nethashes

[29-Oct-18 09:01 PM] yorktronic#2703
so maybe that's their objective

[29-Oct-18 09:01 PM] yorktronic#2703
destroy all other equihash coins

[29-Oct-18 09:01 PM] yorktronic#2703
actually I could be wrong about that

[29-Oct-18 09:01 PM] yorktronic#2703
the sum thing

[29-Oct-18 09:02 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, good luck. there was some controversy when the asics were announced but I dont think it's been detrimental

[29-Oct-18 09:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'm anxious to see what happens with ARRR prices when it hits the exchange.

[29-Oct-18 09:05 PM] actionslacks#4072
dump or moon?

[29-Oct-18 09:07 PM] yorktronic#2703
no idea

[29-Oct-18 09:08 PM] Chewy#0565
small spike, then big dump  followed by $1+ within a year, but who knows.  Just a guess

[29-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Chewy#0565
all depends on how many people are aware of it and how fast, and of course if they like it.

[29-Oct-18 09:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Massive ASIC hashrate spike would be great for Komodo

[29-Oct-18 09:25 PM] yorktronic#2703
Not unless price follows

[29-Oct-18 09:26 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'm speaking as a miner

[29-Oct-18 09:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
75% of the mineable coins are mined by notaries.

[29-Oct-18 09:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hashrate increase doesn't lower that

[29-Oct-18 09:28 PM] yorktronic#2703
what's the total block reward for KMD

[29-Oct-18 09:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
3

[29-Oct-18 09:28 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'm seeing 3 for miners

[29-Oct-18 09:28 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'm confused as to what you mean by "75% of the mineable coins are mined by the notaries"

[29-Oct-18 09:29 PM] yorktronic#2703
I'm not being argumentative here -- I actually don't know how that works I guess

[29-Oct-18 09:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It's pretty self explanatory,  3/4 of the blocks are mined by the 64 notaries that do DPoW . it's coded in the system.  The rest is mined freeforall.  Of hashrate massively spikes only 25% of the minable coin generation is affected by it.  For example Komodo has been recently 4-5x of its initial hashrate pre asic

[29-Oct-18 09:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Price has remained stable

[29-Oct-18 09:33 PM] yorktronic#2703
presumably to pay for the BTC they have to set aside to pay for notarization? and to incentivize running a notary node.

The btc comes from the ICO funds,  the Komodo mining privilege is for hardware and time involved ,  which ibelieve in a year or two will require solid network admin skills,  it already does to an extent

[29-Oct-18 09:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Notary nodes are an implementation of Libertarian Public Works lol 😂

[29-Oct-18 09:37 PM] yorktronic#2703
this is still correct, I assume: "The total number of notaries is 64. Of those nodes, 4 are dev notaries. 30 nodes were re-elected based on performance (total notarization). 30 spots are available for elections."

I believe (if you have created your own pool) that the initial mined coins must enter a transparent address ... they are then to be shielded to a zaddr and from there on will always be private
