can anyone tell me the total supply of ARRR, trying to gauge the current marketcap

[06-Nov-18 03:40 PM] TheGemologist#6023
what’s the exact point why ARRR can’t be traded on a dex ?

[06-Nov-18 03:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
No info on chain gem cos of z tx

[06-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
DEX relies on atomic swaps which needs readable balance info

[06-Nov-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Z transactions be encrypted yo

[06-Nov-18 03:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@MC 25M currently.

[06-Nov-18 03:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
25,167,872

[06-Nov-18 03:42 PM] TheGemologist#6023
thx

[06-Nov-18 03:42 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Now 25,168,128 😛

[06-Nov-18 03:42 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Is there z-messaging?  Maybe viewing keys could be exchanged that way or something

[06-Nov-18 03:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Block height x 256

[06-Nov-18 03:43 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@FishyGuts if Arrr get founds through referential link - will you make new twitter contest with that link (or also DP link) to get more funds and followers too ?

[06-Nov-18 03:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I did ask Crex what it would take to make KMD a base trading pair on their excahnge.    DigPri has it.  Why can't they?

[06-Nov-18 03:43 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah good call Pass!

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I will do a "Screenshot your purchase on Crex" for free arrr.

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also, I believe Crex can do trading promos for us too... keep that in mind.

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] MC#0768
@FishyGuts thank you, and at what rate are we mining? 25m supply now, and say in 3 months?

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
1440x256

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Each day

[06-Nov-18 03:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
At the first halving which is about 4 -5 months away...

[06-Nov-18 03:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Here... one sec.

[06-Nov-18 03:45 PM] FishyGuts#5085

Started August 31 I believe.  So I believe around April 1 is the first halving.

[06-Nov-18 03:47 PM] dwx#9071
What is the current price of ARRR on the exchange? It wont load for me or I would look!

[06-Nov-18 03:47 PM] MC#0768
ok and what is the main point of ARRR, what objective does it seek

[06-Nov-18 03:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023
asks 0.139 kmd

[06-Nov-18 03:47 PM] TheGemologist#6023

[06-Nov-18 03:47 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

(Some mined coins left on T-addresses which is where they’re mined to)

[06-Nov-18 03:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@dwx - We have ecosystem items that people in the community are developing

[06-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Point being it’s the most private and secure crypto in existence

[06-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344

[06-Nov-18 03:48 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
What hollowman said

[06-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Not much adoption yet

[06-Nov-18 03:48 PM] MC#0768
and how is that proven

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Dont forget its feature complete also

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] MC#0768
when has a XMR or ZEC transaction been revealed?

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Secured through DPoW

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Zk-snarks is the most private protocol

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Smash the two together

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Need that link from zcash dev

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Oszy#5734
xmr is not impossible to analyze if really wanted to

[06-Nov-18 03:49 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Re sapling and z txs

[06-Nov-18 03:50 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
You either have some info or 0 info which would you say is more private?

[06-Nov-18 03:50 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@MC  - It boils down to Obfuscated data on the blockchain...... or a bunch of zeros.

[06-Nov-18 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
There is and will be some day some desire for some three lettered agency to break XMR code, and they have data to try to do so.

[06-Nov-18 03:51 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
And dont forget this is handled in a very simople manner

[06-Nov-18 03:52 PM] CHMEX#0686
Most problems are because users leak their data by using z trx wrongly.
With PIRATE you cant do it wrong

[06-Nov-18 03:52 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Xmr vs ARRR 

“It’s grade school t-ball versus the New York Yankees”

[06-Nov-18 03:53 PM] MC#0768
right so buy ARRR because it sounds like a pirate and its more private but no maths or workings to show. OK, here buy this cat, it will make you fly.

[06-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
“No maths” are you good with maths?

[06-Nov-18 03:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Check block exploerer @MC

[06-Nov-18 03:53 PM] Acura#2748
Easyrabbit Exchange would list us for a small fee  - Had written yesterday with them

[06-Nov-18 03:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
See for yourself

[06-Nov-18 03:54 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Study zcash and introduce forced z txs to it

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@MC

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Oszy#5734
@Acura is that like changelly?

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Are you familiar with ZKSnarks?

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
I guess we do need some easily digestible diagrams explaining the differences, “go do your homework n00b” will only get us so far

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Lol

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Are you familiar with how it works and how it acheives its privacy strength?>

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Are you familiar with dPow?

[06-Nov-18 03:55 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think he looked at exploerer and vanished

[06-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
His dot is still green

[06-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Acura#2748
@Oszy yes - fee would be 1100 $ - 2000$ - depends on the package

[06-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Oszy#5734
So it's like onboarding but we have no control over the price.

[06-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Forgive the callousness @MC, it’s easy to get frustrated after being around awhile

[06-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
We know what we have, but need the 10,000ft overview for passerby’s

[06-Nov-18 04:01 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Maybe we are too private 😂😂

[06-Nov-18 04:06 PM] vogelfreund#4122
ahoi, cant send arrr after sinc the chain 100% since yesterday, have the latest agama version.

[06-Nov-18 04:07 PM] vogelfreund#4122
days ago it works

[06-Nov-18 04:09 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could be lots of small utxos. Can be intensive on cpu. Try sending a smaller amount?

[06-Nov-18 04:09 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Do you get an opid amd then failed tx

[06-Nov-18 04:10 PM] vogelfreund#4122
ok try it. small like 1k?  . no

[06-Nov-18 04:10 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
If you have had many smaller deposits and then want to send out a large amount  it can be hard on cpu. Try 500

[06-Nov-18 04:10 PM] vogelfreund#4122
thanks

[06-Nov-18 04:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
UTXOs take space.   1 M arrr is the same spave as 1 arrrr.

[06-Nov-18 04:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So if too many UTXO's are present it will take far too long to execute and sometimes it will fail.

[06-Nov-18 04:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So sending small amounts at a time will combine them all into one utxo.

[06-Nov-18 04:12 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Is the combine option new user friendly?

[06-Nov-18 04:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Think of a UTXO like a dollar bill but with varying denominations.

[06-Nov-18 04:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have 1000 bills its harder to move than 1 or 2.

[06-Nov-18 04:20 PM] dukeleto#7326
Just like 100 $1 dollar bills take up much more physical volume than 1 $100 bill, 100 1ARRR UTXOs take up a lot more kilobytes of space in a transaction, than 1 100ARRR UTXO.

[06-Nov-18 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
and a transaction is like an envelope. You can only fit so much physical money/space in an envelope, and there is a max size (in kilobytes) for a transaction

[06-Nov-18 04:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
This is why setting your mining payout as high as you can deal with, is good for your wallet and making the funds easier to use, without sweeping many small utxos into larger ones

[06-Nov-18 04:56 PM] IsekiSolari#2059
Quick question guys, 

- How fast is the Pirate Blockchain in term of Tx/Sec? 

I know it's build on the KMD blockchain so logically it should have the same Tx/sec but I just want to be sure...

( https://dexstats.info/scale/index.html ) 

Thank  you for your time 😃

[06-Nov-18 05:05 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@IsekiSolari to my estimations  it's about 17 tx/sec - not very fast cause these are only z-tx available (z are slower). It will be faster after upgrading to sapling (smaller z-tx - more tx per block - more capacity). How much faster - idk that. @dukeleto  you have some estimation how much faster tx are after sapling?

[06-Nov-18 05:07 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
here they say it will be 5x faster https://z.cash/blog/cultivating-sapling-faster-zksnarks/

pretty good then

[06-Nov-18 05:09 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so we can expect about 80-90 ztx/s after sapling
