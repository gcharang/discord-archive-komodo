there is no founders reward, that is just some left over test code

[04-Jul-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
look at the coinbase mining outputs, there is no need to debate this

[04-Jul-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so clearly the devs are not dumping the founders reward that doesnt exist

[04-Jul-19 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

1514.56 PIRATE was burned should compensate for the 0.11984984  in block 1
never mind I just looked at the coinbase mining outputs
