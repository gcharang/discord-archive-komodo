Pirate is now also listed on CryptoBridge beside DigitalPrice
It’s done, Pirate is listed on CryptoBridge. This makes CryptoBridge the second Exchange to implement z addresses. After Pirate emerged…

Good Day 
There are now around 40 Hours left to migrate coins. It can take some time. It took one user 3 days to migrate 400k.  ...

Hiya @Cryptofist  yes I have and know about Pirate : ) Some people I know speak highly of Pirate as well. 

Initially I wanted to approach Pirate as well for listing on our exchange ResDEX. However we are atomic swap based; and hence currently it won't be possible : ( 

I will join Discord permanently as well thank you for inviting !

[13-Feb-19 01:37 PM] CHMEX#0686
That could be addressed with TPirate  1:1 backed PIRATE Coin

[13-Feb-19 01:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
100% ^

[13-Feb-19 01:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
would also be easier for exchanges to integrate

[13-Feb-19 01:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ive been thinking we need some tradeable sidechain action. Or a 1:1 ERC20 (This has other potential... )

[13-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So TPirate would be another chain with non-forced Z addr then right?

[13-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
heeeeeeeeeere comes da genie

Swapping  ARRR to TARRR on dexstats too?

[13-Feb-19 01:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
🤔

[13-Feb-19 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
maybe....
it's one of those things that is simple in words and takes a bit for execution, especially since no one is volunteering to make it 😛

[13-Feb-19 01:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah.

[13-Feb-19 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
but the "blueprint" is there for it to be possible

[13-Feb-19 01:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I feel like it would need to be super transparently swapped too

[13-Feb-19 01:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
What would be cool is to issue new coins on a chain on demand.

[13-Feb-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_import=PUBKEY can do that

[13-Feb-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
still experimental, but the idea was that the owner of -ac_pubkey= for the chain can create coins bases on whatever external event

[13-Feb-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
requires trust in the -ac_pubkey owner, but allows to solve otherwise problematic things

[13-Feb-19 01:55 PM] CHMEX#0686
wow nice! I will try that!

[13-Feb-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a selfimport rpc call. its a bit tricky to use but you can ask Alright

[13-Feb-19 01:56 PM] CHMEX#0686
thanks!

@CHMEX I've been trying to migrate my funds. It's not working. Sometimes I get errors like "Unable to fetch data (code: getDashBoardUpdate)".  I tried using the service on DevStats, it shows sent, but nothing happens. I'm confused here. Someone help me

[14-Feb-19 07:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
do you know which version you are using someting >= 0.3.2a ?

[14-Feb-19 07:17 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
Yes. I was using 0.3.3a. But dropped it down after reading your instruction. It's on 0.3.2a

[14-Feb-19 07:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok great than you should be fine
is the chain 100% synced in the status bar?

[14-Feb-19 07:18 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
It is

[14-Feb-19 07:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
does it say someblock like height: 240259 ?

[14-Feb-19 07:19 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
Mine is 240239 on both sides

[14-Feb-19 07:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
hmm ok you are not 100% synched.
Can you close agama and open it again

[14-Feb-19 07:21 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
Just checked again. It's a 100%. But there's still a difference of 10. I should wait?

[14-Feb-19 07:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
close it wait 1 min and open it again

[14-Feb-19 07:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
are you on windows? Not that it matters but just checking

[14-Feb-19 07:22 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
Yes. Windows 10.

[14-Feb-19 07:22 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
Close the whole app? Or just the coin?

[14-Feb-19 07:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
close the whole app

[14-Feb-19 07:26 AM] PirateHodlor#3573
Okay.

So that people can trade one for the other, silly goose.

[26-Feb-19 04:34 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It boggles my mind on about 30 different levels as to why anyone would even contemplate giving up ARRR for USDT 🤦🏽

[26-Feb-19 04:42 PM] meatspoon#7860
And that is your choice. Others who don’t hold your exact opinions might be interested in the pairing.

[26-Feb-19 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not an opinion, it's a fact that everything that makes PIRATE worthwhile is the antithesis of USDT

[26-Feb-19 04:53 PM] meatspoon#7860
@Likewise hey dad, can you explain to grumpy pony how liquidity is good for markets?  And how not all market sentiment perfectly mirrors his own?

[26-Feb-19 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the ability to trade a Porsche for a dog shit is "liquidity"; doing that isn't a good idea either, unless you're the owner of the dog shit

[26-Feb-19 05:00 PM] meatspoon#7860
If opinions are like assholes, 99% of your epidermis is covered with brown stars.

[26-Feb-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
let us avoid personal insults

[26-Feb-19 05:03 PM] meatspoon#7860
So no personal insults, but incessant, arrogant implications of other people being stupid/ignorant because they don’t share your views are tolerated and excused. Got it.

[26-Feb-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a fine line, i hope you can understand the need for it

[26-Feb-19 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Your "implications" are what you read into my words when you don't actually read my words

[26-Feb-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
stating your opinion about X being good/bad, etc. this seems ok

[26-Feb-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
making personal insults because you disagree, that is not ok

[26-Feb-19 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
when you make personal insults, it becomes personal

[26-Feb-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
keep it objective statements and it is not a problem, you can have opinions that dont agree with others too

[26-Feb-19 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and shouldnt have to worry about being insulted personally for having a non-universal opinion

[26-Feb-19 05:07 PM] meatspoon#7860
Recap:  i bring some good news to the ARRR channel. Genie, being, uh, the type of person he is, shits all over the news and implies (once again) that all currencies except KMD and ARRR are crap and that people would be idiots to hold them.  This guy is in every channel constantly telling people they are stupid. He is basically the informal face of KMD and he is extraordinarily rude.

[26-Feb-19 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
That I find BTC and USDT abhorrent is not "all currencies"

[26-Feb-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
as i say it is a fine line between free speech and making it personal

[26-Feb-19 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of who makes personal insults, I will ask them to stop it

[26-Feb-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and i will allow posting of personal opinions, regardless if I agree with it or not

[26-Feb-19 05:09 PM] meatspoon#7860
I keep saying it, others keep saying it, Genie constantly bumping his gums is a bad look for the project.

{Reactions}
💯 

[26-Feb-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe sometimes I will also offer my opionion, but not force all to have the same

[26-Feb-19 05:09 PM] jl777c#5810
well from what I see, genie posts his opinion that USDT is not a very good "crypto", then you start insulting him personally

[26-Feb-19 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I keep saying it, others keep saying it, Genie constantly bumping his gums is a bad look for the project.`
As opposed to 97% of your posts being personal attacks?

[26-Feb-19 05:10 PM] meatspoon#7860
Today will be no different. I will receive DM’s from people who agree with me but just don’t like public bickering.

[26-Feb-19 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if anything, @meatspoon your making the personal insults which makes the channels feel more hostile. genie could certainly use a softer touch, but it is within the informal rules we have that personal opinions are allowed

[26-Feb-19 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`but just don’t like public bickering.`
Then, maybe, post something contributive as to why USDT would be a "good thing" in and of itself instead of personally attacking me

[26-Feb-19 05:12 PM] meatspoon#7860
Did i not mention liquidity and freedom of choice?  Do those not count as positives?

[26-Feb-19 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
those are indeed positive attributes
