Replacing `\033[` (5 keystrokes) with `${code}` (10 keystrokes) is an example of 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should', imo

[13-Nov-18 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I had the function of colour from somethig else, and just copy pasted it into it so it was easier to read... its not degigned to spamm bets, it was origionally just to play without errors ad I added spam to it later.

[13-Nov-18 12:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 do you account the refunds on your stats?

[13-Nov-18 12:30 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
since they are a non-event after the chain catches up, all my stats do is inc the refunds var and loop back (no gain or loss)

[13-Nov-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah same .. if the tx stops being able to be resent with sendrawtransacion, I just send another dicebet 5s later

[13-Nov-18 12:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
save txid of failed send

[13-Nov-18 12:33 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i mean the win with 1:1 returns

[13-Nov-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is not illegal at the consensus level, but rpc prevents it

[13-Nov-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe someone using very old version

[13-Nov-18 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```        elif [[ "$won" == "$wager" || "$result" == "null" ]] ; then

            jumpto $start```

[13-Nov-18 12:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that what you mean @siu - Chainmakers ?

[13-Nov-18 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example, if i bet 0.01 KMDICE at 3 odds i get sometimes a win status with 0.01 reward

[13-Nov-18 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is not the nromal win

[13-Nov-18 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
james tells me this is a refund

[13-Nov-18 12:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
right, that's that above

[13-Nov-18 12:38 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i would like to account what percentage of total bets get this

[13-Nov-18 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i have no stats in my script 😦

[13-Nov-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`wins: 1 losses: 315 pushes: 86`
`wins: 9 losses: 54 pushes: 17`
`wins: 36 losses: 136 pushes: 33`

[13-Nov-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that's all I stll have up

[13-Nov-18 12:41 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ok

[13-Nov-18 12:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

[13-Nov-18 01:30 PM] Mylo#8306
Those comparisons with eos are interesting.  @siu - Chainmakers do they link to an eos block explorer for validation?
I’m walking atm but might add to today’s tech Tuesday

But if i understand correctly, they need to stake 150k eos to have the contract running and the dapp is only generatimg 1.45% profit 😬 😬

[13-Nov-18 01:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
ohh, wait, no... its just 5k staked

[13-Nov-18 01:52 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

bit lost on this one dude migh ahve to wait for james... it seems its trying to rebroadcast a tx wher the entropy is spent... when it shouldnt be trying to do that.

perhaps read the pinned items?

[15-Nov-18 10:15 AM] TonyL#3577
http://docs.kmdice.bet/en/latest/playguide.html seems there is a mistake in chain params on Step1 (no -addnode  param so user will just start his own chain but not connect to existing one)

[15-Nov-18 10:19 AM] TonyL#3577
And on Step4 too

[15-Nov-18 10:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Also there is no info from which repo/branch komodod should be built

if the chain is being notarized, there is mostly no need to do  -addnode

when we win... is it normal to receive more than the what we had bet ?

[15-Nov-18 02:52 PM] jorian#4555
that's how betting normally works

[15-Nov-18 03:00 PM] jusoaresf#3291
tks
so bet * odds is what is in the bet...

[15-Nov-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
on a win:
if you bet 2 at 10 odds, you get 22 `2*10 + 2`
if you bet 2 at 5 odds, you get 12 `2*5 + 2`
you get the payout *plus* your bet back

[15-Nov-18 03:30 PM] jusoaresf#3291
yes... tks. cannot forget the "redeem" of the value we placed on the bet

Left my computer running for a couple of hours betting every 30 seconds.

[16-Nov-18 01:17 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Hi folks,
I need help understanding how to interpret the command outputs where 2 consecutive equal commands & parameters produce 2 different responses.
First as win then as refund or pending...

[16-Nov-18 01:17 PM] jusoaresf#3291
First example
```
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 25372d9f211b6e55b879371f62da530fbdf316c74897026c349bab56a3577e95
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "win",
  "won": 24
}
```
in the sequence
```
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 25372d9f211b6e55b879371f62da530fbdf316c74897026c349bab56a3577e95
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "win",
  "won": 6
}
```

Another one went like this
```$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 4e208c87bfd333562bb3ad3ca5967d87038013b43e47334a51b4541133d208d2
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "win",
  "won": 10.5
}
```
and then
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 4e208c87bfd333562bb3ad3ca5967d87038013b43e47334a51b4541133d208d2
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "bet still pending"
}```

So... we need to refrain to report as a winning? How long?

[16-Nov-18 01:21 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
seems like you got a refund.

[16-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
orphans happen

[16-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Yes, nothing wrong with the balance... it's just that same inputs reports wining 24 then wining 6

[16-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
until it is confirmed, it isnt confirmed

[16-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jusoaresf#3291
so we need to somehow wait before concluding a win is a win

[16-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and even after it is confirmed, it can still be reorged

[16-Nov-18 01:29 PM] jusoaresf#3291
and when we loose too... I did not c&p but last night before going to sleep I lost just about everything and now the kmdice is still there

[16-Nov-18 01:35 PM] jusoaresf#3291
so... could we cascade bets then?
Say it says I won a bet. Then I bet that that win is going to stick after x confirmations... then I lose 😃

[16-Nov-18 01:35 PM] TonyL#3577
