USDC   @ca333        It is an ETH token, and exchange requires ETH as a handling fee. I am hoping to have a KMD USD.

@ca333 Hey. You write that the second round of the atomicDex contest begins.
I'm curious. 
And there are no winners of the first round? They won't be announced?
It wasn't a competition?

On the HyperDex I can't put sell order of 3.77 Rick to KMD. 3 Rick to KMD is fine, 3.7 Rick to KMD is also fine. But 3.77 it hits Internal Server Error. It has been blocked by CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

Also when I put an order and it is OPEN, there is no option to close it (if you decide not to do the trade).

I wouldn't doubt that they could get your wallet balances now, especially if you use kyc exchanges for anything.. Whether or not they can track shit down from 3-4 years ago is another question.

I think it would be wise to switch over to dex

[29-Jul-19 05:44 PM] JimD#9272
when I liquidate 50 BTC after less than a year and move it to my bank account they don't need to know anything accept what I tell them

[29-Jul-19 05:45 PM] jl777c#5810
since atomicDEX doesnt KYC, as long as you dont link your dex address to other addresses, then there is no link to you. keeping it segregated is pretty hard especially if you need to convert to fiat. zaddr based swaps will help immensely with privacy, and PIRATE will be the most private haven for funds

[29-Jul-19 05:48 PM] JimD#9272
Would sending BTC to coinbase from a DEX count as linking it my dex address ?

[29-Jul-19 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes

[29-Jul-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you had 2 dex addresses you could intervene a BTC <-> PIRATE and PIRATE <-> BTC swap

[29-Jul-19 05:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the ending BTC address being a never used address. there wont be a direct way to correlate, but this requires a lot of other such swaps so simply detecting you are doing this wouldnt be easy

@hyperDEX how does the tipping work, how does it know the public adresss of a discord user?

Not made to hold your coins longterm. More temporary hotwallet
