[telegram] <DRGNorDIE> 👆 Solid advice (re @Regnar: But those are still on your computer, reality is you use your computer for other things that may increase risk. Like browsing the internet, playing games, downloading things etc. A hardware wallet has one purpose, to store funds, so I'd say they are safer for the average user.)

[01-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ketnet40> I search coins and make initial contacts for a top5 exchange. Better to be on telegram, not mail (to slow). And not free.

[01-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <PTYX11> Bittrex, Binance, Huobi, and other major exchanges have added Komodo for free. One could argue that Komodo shouldn't pay for listing fees anymore. The exchange benefits more by adding it for free. (re @Ketnet40: I search coins and make initial contacts for a top5 exchange. Better to be on telegram, not mail (to slow). And not free.)

[01-Apr-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <PTYX11> You're welcome to reach out but I'm 99% sure Komodo won't waste funds to be listed on a small/medium exchange.
