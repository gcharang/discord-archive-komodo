[telegram] <Sungonightly> Just sell your Kmd diligently, then I can buy again and get 5% bonus a year for the coins. Komodo comes back strengthened when all speculators have sold. 1.20 Euro is for me still a high increase in contrast to February.

[telegram] <enfarktus> I've been buying kmd since 2017. If you want to buy, I can sell it right away. (re @Sungonightly: Just sell your Kmd diligently, then I can buy again and get 5% bonus a year for the coins.

[22-Jun-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Sungonightly> It's actually quite simple what just happened here, you sold or swapped the Komodo and jumped on the Bitcoin train. But Bitcoin doesn't grow as fast as it does today and stays at the same level, then many jump off and invest in the other coins again. Nobody complained when Kmd stood at 1.50 Euro.

[telegram] <ionstar> I don't panic that easily (as a hardcore hodler throughout 2018). But it is frustrating a bit. Maybe the rise of the past few weeks was due to KMD withdrawal locks after the agama hack? Or maybe the person(s) who were stealing the KMD, are selling it off.

[22-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptosim0n> Most of alts are dropping because of the bitcoin surge. I dont think this is the hacker dumping or people dumping because of the hack

[22-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> I did notice (last week) this hacker was sending "his" balance to a new address every 10 or so minutes. I dont know if at some point exchanges will lose track and allow some of these funds to be deposited, and then sold off.

[22-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptosim0n> If the hacker sells now, he’s fucking stupid. Why does he try and hack the agama wallet if he’s then going to dump when prices are at all time low btc wise.

[22-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Because it's free money for him anyway? (re @cryptosim0n: If the hacker sells now, he’s fucking stupid. Why does he try and hack the agama wallet if he’s then going to dump when prices are at all time low btc wise.)

[22-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> I mean if I were the hacker, I would try to get rid of this stash as quickly as possible... get it "washed" into clean crypto/cash

[22-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptosim0n> Could be, who knows... i dont mind the hacker selling now. Im glad all funds are recovered without the need to hardfork.

[22-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tobiasnunes> How can someone prevent receiving some funds of a decentralized coin? That is not possible. If it is, where is the freedom in crypto? Governments could restrict any addresses they want to then and so people would have no freedom at all anymore to buy goods for example in a store (re @ionstar: I did notice (last week) this hacker was sending "his" balance to a new address every 10 or so minutes. I dont know if at some point exchanges will lose track and allow some of these funds to be deposited, and then sold off.)

[22-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptosim0n> Some were reimbursed, some were recovered (like mine)

[22-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <cryptosim0n> This. I dont think we should stop the hacker from selling. This is crypto and should be decentralized (re @tobiasnunes: How can someone prevent receiving some funds of a decentralized coin? That is not possible. If it is, where is the freedom in crypto?

[22-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> Centralised exchanges can ofcourse track and block/seize assets coming from addresses used by hackers. Washer services and decentralised exchanges are different.

[telegram] <ionstar> KYC, though hated (by me as well) is probably coming at some point for all centralised exchanges through regulation pressure, as it is a way for tax agencies to find out how many crypto assets you have and tax you accordingly.

[22-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <tobiasnunes> It has nothing to do with let him go. Of course we can try to track him or not let him cash out fiat. But ban deposits should be impossible (re @ionstar: I don't see why we should congratulate this person on his successful hack and let him get away with his loot.)

[22-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> I dont think they can prevent deposits, as you can send whatever funds to whatever address. But the destination address is owned by the exchange, and thats where it can be stopped. (re @tobiasnunes: So it's this what happenes? Or can they technical prevent deposits?)

[22-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[22-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> I read something yesterday about some international regulatory office, that they want all exchanges to submit client data to them, so basically governments can track where funds go... and ofcourse can then be taxed.

[telegram] <tobiasnunes> I mean for private sale between two people it would still be working, but the government could even look your history of addresses and if any is not connected to a person it could mean you get to a red list

[22-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <ionstar> That could happen. But then you could have private addresses, and have a debitcard connected to it and pay day to day stuff using that debitcard.
