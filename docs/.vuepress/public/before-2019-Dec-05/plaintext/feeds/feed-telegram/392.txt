[telegram] <Ggokhangark> Nope. All shitcoins are pumping first every time. Then big coins turn will come. (re @Kriptodan Batan Adam: All of coins move up everyday but kmd still same area. Maybe people dont wanna Buy it for not believing again)

[telegram] <Andres> Sorry guys but anybody knows how to get back the KMD hacked from the vulnerable Agama Wallets?

[telegram] <Kriptodan Batan Adam> Tell me, btc is now stable and coins move up everyday after btc increase or decrease kmd again dump dump, but people gain money from shit coin (re @Ggokhangark: Nope. All shitcoins are pumping first every time. Then big coins turn will come.)

[10-Sep-19 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Keytothegate> Can you hint me some of those coins "moving up everyday", sounds like reasonable investment opportunity😂 (re @Kriptodan Batan Adam: All of coins move up everyday but kmd still same area. Maybe people dont wanna Buy it for not believing again)

[telegram] <Ggokhangark> So it means people knows how to earn money mate-) Do not judge kmd with today’s price. Do not forget that only a few projects from thousands have made some real products until now.  
Put your money and sit back, be relax. This is a long marathon race. (re @Kriptodan Batan Adam: Tell me, btc is now stable and coins move up everyday after btc increase or decrease kmd again dump dump, but people gain money from shit coin)

[10-Sep-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Ggokhangark> And do not forget that kmd is a real star of this crypto world. Price will be incredible huge in a few years.

[telegram] <Keytothegate> Yes and you don't really make any efforts to make it better for yourself. Mostly just daily negativity sharing and clueless claims about the market situation and magical alts mooning in the middle of quiet season for alts. May I ask if it's possible that you have quite short time investment in your mind and maybe you have invested too much? Komodo will rise but it might take some time for masses to understand what they are dealing with... I think most of us here are in for years or forever and somehow i get the impression that you might have been chasing some pump and got trapped and now feel frustrated. And it's understandable, i get it. But be easy on yourself (and others😄) (re @Kriptodan Batan Adam: İ am sadness due to everyday decreasing)

[telegram] <Lukasdzs> We are ready for today. Only 9 hours and 40 minutes left. Yesterday I spoke about a long-term strategy. A lot of people DM'ed me about it. It is a quite simple strategy. Our team had contact with various news channels. Once the initial pump is done (the buys of you guys) and outsiders see the coin going up, we will spread news via various news channels which make outsiders interested and slowly buy in on the coin. This gives our members a perfect window to sell their coins with a decent profit.

[telegram] <psyfont> Hello ,
I’m trying AtomicDEX with iOS and I can’t enter the new created wallet. When I introduce the password I’m invited to create a 5 number passcode again, and then again to the locked wallet. 
Any suggestion?
Thanks

[telegram] <Kenny_Kobayashi> I dont want to be negative. I want the price to appreciate along with the substantial development taking place over the past few months

[telegram] <Keytothegate> Ok, it will in a long term👍 Markets are bad and stagnant for pretty much any alts now. But Komodo is making a lot of progress in actual development, this will be seen also on the price sooner or later👍 (re @Kenny_Kobayashi: I dont want to be negative.
