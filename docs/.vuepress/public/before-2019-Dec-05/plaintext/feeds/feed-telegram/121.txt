[telegram] <Regnar> Yes that seed is yours forever, just make sure you write it down offline as well so you don't lose it. (re @Coneyboy: hey I have created my agama wallet and chose lite mode with and a wallet seed generated by the wallet. I have checked a few days in a row and my small amount of kmd is there. I now wish to send all my remaining kmd out of my ledger to my agama wallet. provided I keep that 24 word phrase secret that wallet is mine forever yes??)

[telegram] <Hermes08> With that 24 word seed you should always be able to view your balance using Agama, as long as you keep it safe you will be ok.

[telegram] <Brenny431> I don't understand your question completely. Are you asking if
1. You can use a different mnemonic within the coinomi app? -short answer is yes!
2. Can you use a mnemonic that originated from a different wallet alongside the tutorial above? - depends on a few things but you should be able to. (re @matanajwa: can you use memonic from a wallet other than coinomi admin?)

[29-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> To add to my answer of 2. 
- The derivation path that the original wallet uses for some coins may be a different format to what coinomi uses. In this case you can head over to the official support channel for some assistance (re @Brenny431: I don't understand your question completely. Are you asking if

[29-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> Namely ETH in derivation path case, some wallets use the longer version. But we won't talk about ETH here ;) (re @Brenny431: To add to my answer of 2.
