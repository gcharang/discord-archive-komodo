[telegram] <Crypto> Ye I agree when usd or euro starts to collapse is when we see more mass adoption. I think people in Turkey will start to research crypto more this year (re @mustuathegrey: Crypto will much explosive at the beginning of all fiats starts to collapse including usd & euro. Still not much mass adoptation in Turkey because of lira value drop against usd so it will not effect that much imo.)

Already wait 2hours. Still pending. Few months ago only took 20-30mins with that fee. (re @mo7881: Eth has a long term problem. I think the boom wont use Eth as its too bogged down already.

[telegram] <Block> Need help importing private keys into komodo wallet from nano

[15-Aug-18 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> Hi Brenny, is it true that
Coinomi wallet allows monthly rewards for holding KMD ?
Am i too late to claim ? (re @Brenny431: Coinomi wallet allows for holding KMD. And is available in the app store :))

[15-Aug-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> 1. You cannot claim directly from Coinomi you will have to extract your private key to claim. 
2. Certain conditions will need to be met. (Transaction has to have been sent to coinomi with locktime enabled) and the standard conditions for rewards. 
3. Sending from Coinomi doesn't have the locktime enabled. 
I can help you with a little walkthrough if needed. 
First you will have to check that your address has reward to claim by searching it at atomicexplorer and checking the rewards check tool (re @CryptoBlockchain38: Hi Brenny, is it true that
Coinomi wallet allows monthly rewards for holding KMD ?
Am i too late to claim ?)

[15-Aug-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> Hmmm. I wonder if I should make a video on this when I next have some rewards to claim :/

[15-Aug-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> A video. Great idea. (re @Brenny431: Hmmm. I wonder if I should make a video on this when I next have some rewards to claim :/)

[15-Aug-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <J> Yea, like not having to withdraw from an exchange :P (re @mo7881: I find myself actively avoiding withdrawing ERC20 tokens from exchanges as its such a hassle. KMD solves so many of the problems.)

[15-Aug-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> I should note that since coinomi is decentralized and only a wallet interface, with some cool features, it allows nothing. The rewards are simply part of the KMD blockchain and coding. As long as you hold your private keys (for your KMD wallet) you should be able to claim the rewards regardless of the wallet provider. (re @CryptoBlockchain38: Hi Brenny, is it true that
Coinomi wallet allows monthly rewards for holding KMD ?
Am i too late to claim ?)

[15-Aug-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> If i have the keys of my KMD Wallet i can claim my monthly reward? To who? (re @Brenny431: I should note that since coinomi is decentralized and only a wallet interface, with some cool features, it allows nothing.

[15-Aug-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> You import your private key for the address which has rewards to claim. Once you click the 'claim' button in agama wallet your reward amount is sent to your address.

[15-Aug-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Brenny431> For claiming rewards this is the basis. 
1. You extract your addresses private key from your coinomi recovery phrase. 
2. Import that into agama desktop wallet
3. Click claim button 
4. Confirm it. (re @Brenny431: You import your private key for the address which has rewards to claim. Once you click the 'claim' button in agama wallet your reward amount is sent to your address.)
