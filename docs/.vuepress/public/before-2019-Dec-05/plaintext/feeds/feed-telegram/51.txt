[telegram] <JtheLizzard> I typed komodo and it sayd no project found (re @CryptoVitamins: So do we type ‘Komodo’ or Komodo platform?)

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <benohanlon> I've emailed them to ask both 'komodo' and 'komodo platform' to count but no reply yet

[telegram] <Ostap> when coinex listing?

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <benohanlon> did it work when you put komodo platform? (re @JtheLizzard: I typed komodo and it sayd no project found)

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> I type Komodo and it worked

[12-Jul-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> Only Komodo worked for me

[12-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> it says to use the coinmarketcap name, so I guess "Komodo"

[12-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <barbierir> asking for "/position Komodo" works too

[12-Jul-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <bdouble> No.  It looks like you started to vote.  You might have derailed it when you /position.  There are a couple other things you need to submit after you enter the project name.

[12-Jul-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <bdouble> It will ask you what is special about it.  Then it will tell you the vote was submitted

[12-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <N21_0> ok as i know there is no confirmation message from the bot after the input Project Name (re @bdouble: It will ask you what is special about it.  Then it will tell you the vote was submitted)

[12-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> That is correct. (re @bdouble: It will ask you what is special about it.  Then it will tell you the vote was submitted)

[12-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> When you have filled in Komodo, you get another question. (re @N21_0: ok as i know there is no confirmation message from the bot after the input Project Name)

[12-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Wil> Voting_KuCoin_Bot:
1-If you haven’t done so, make sure you sign-up to KuCoin. You will need your KuCoin account email address in order to vote.
2-Project Name You Want To Get Listed (spell the name in full, DON'T USE THE TICKER)
3-Make sure you spell the name of the project correctly as it appears in coinmarketcap (if is not listed on coinmarketcap spell the name just like it is written in the whitepaper)
4-You can check position and number of votes for any projects with the following function:
/position Komodo (re @Quesho89: I couldn't vote yet... I've already started a private conversation with the trading bot but what about now?)
