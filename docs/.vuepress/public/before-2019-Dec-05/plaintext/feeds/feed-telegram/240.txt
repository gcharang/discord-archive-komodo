[telegram] <polycryptoblog> Exchanges hold deposits for lots of confirmations as an additional security measure against double spends,  they don’t need to with KMD but still do anyway to play it safe

[14-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <GarvinY> KMD is put into the wallet, 5% per month?

[14-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> 5.1% a year. If you do not claim monthly you will stop incurring rewards at the one month mark. Once claimed you will again start collecting rewards.

[14-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> I put all of mine into my wallet and I’ll just open up agama lite once a month and claim them.

[14-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <GarvinY> How can I get it monthly?Put kmd in  wallet for a month?

[14-Mar-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <wktong> Consider to buy some Komodo now.

[14-Mar-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> A few hours after you deposit it in agama you will notice a ‘claim’ option that will show the amount of KMD you have gained since holding them in the wallet. If you don’t claim that once a month the number will stop getting bigger. (re @GarvinY: How can I get it monthly?Put kmd in  wallet for a month?)

[14-Mar-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <emmettttt> If you claim it more often than once a month make sure what you are claiming is worth more than the transaction fee.

[14-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Regnar> Yea this hasn't historically been a trading channel. There are trading channels out there for KMD, but this is generally more knowledge and investor based. People who are interested in the project and long term potential, not short term price actions.
