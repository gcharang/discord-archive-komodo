[telegram] <Lennart> in Komodo they usually work on all fronts simultaniously and then release things when they're done. The mobile dex thing will be released as part of the rebranding process, when Komodo finally receives the new brand style

[telegram] <ethanwilliamg> Oh i see, I thought the mobile dex was coming first since the alpha is going on if im not mistaken (re @Lennart: in Komodo they usually work on all fronts simultaniously and then release things when they're done.

[telegram] <David> It is now fashionable to take cryptos linked to another and backed with a good exchange to have the desired pump. How does komodo benefit? In nothing...

[18-Mar-19 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> What? Redfox is a company that promotes Komodo products to other companies as a service. They have a coin built with Komodo and instead of doing an ICO or dICO they are choosing to do an IEO. Which basically means they are selling their coins on an exchange. It's very much a shared marketing idea imo. They get access to the exchanges customers and have a simple established platform from which to sell their coins (raise funds). This brings awareness to Komodo and the ecosystem, a successful IEO will also mean much more funds raised specifically for the purpose of bringing companies to Komodo to build on the project. Komodo does benefit, especially in the medium and long term. If you were chasing a price pump, the market is much more mature (though not fully mature) to not pump with an announcement of a project essentially fundraising. (re @David: It is now fashionable to take cryptos linked to another and backed with a good exchange to have the desired pump. How does komodo benefit? In nothing...)
