ADD THIS AMA TO YOUR CALENDAR - https://evt.mx/MxFL58Ly 

A few weeks ago, we've launched one of two new flagship products, the AtomicDEX. Because the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we’ve decided to hold an AMA. You can ask the team anything regarding more information about the development, timelines, future plans for AtomicDEX and so on.

We are asking our community to post their questions in this channel, and we'll choose the most popular ones based on how many ￼⬆  each question receives. We will also answer questions live, if time permits.

@mrtzmp3 Yes, we will choose the most popular ones based on how many 'upvote' each question receives

Ok mate , probably not the most priority request , but have y thought about costum layouts of the Dex? Many trade often and would it be nice to can costomize the Dex ? Darkmode , light mode ok , am talking I upload any picture for background .

A quick suggestion: it would be nice to have market rate for the swap. And also how much the bid price is off the market price. Say for eg, 1 kmd is 1.0 usdc. So if my bid 1,10, I'm +10%.

🤔 

[31-Jul-19 08:55 PM] Prometheus#2390
Also, if we can have an idea of the orders placed to know what is the current liquidity of each coin.

[31-Jul-19 10:18 PM] Guinnessstache#3821
How quickly can new ERC20 tokens for swapping be added?

[31-Jul-19 10:52 PM] yorklab#7270
The DEX fee is about .13% for takers. Those DEX fees are used to buy KMD. If 5 different projects are using the AtomicDEX back-end software (MM2), do they all have the same basic DEX fee, and are the DEX fees from all those projects used to purchase KMD?

[01-Aug-19 03:54 AM] Alexfrog#1338
but....that sounds like a reason to own KMD.  I thought KMD was supposed to be useless 😉 😄

[01-Aug-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i have said KMD doesnt charge a tax, i never said there was no reason to own it. just having all it has and able to claim 5% rewards, that alone should suffice

[01-Aug-19 03:57 AM] Alexfrog#1338
indeed, the smilies were to convey my sarcasm

Will there be a voting system for the next coins that get added to the atomicdex?

Will you incentive traders for making many trades ? I am thinking a lottery where your amount of trades are entry tickets for some kind of pricepool , example taken from the fees ? Or even more cheap trading fees , like for owning bnb on binance ?

[01-Aug-19 09:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@mrtzmp3 with the market maker bot the team is making that connects to CEX, traders will get a bot that will do arb at whatever the user sets as their profit margin

[01-Aug-19 09:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Free money is a good incentive 😃

[01-Aug-19 09:50 AM] mrtzmp3#2896
Wow

[01-Aug-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now think about someone that sets profit at 5%. So whatever they can buy on the centralized exchanges (market buy), on the dex it will be market price +5%

[01-Aug-19 11:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This guys starts to make money

[01-Aug-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now i see this guy making money without doing much, set and forget and re-balance funds when needed.

[01-Aug-19 11:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now i like free money and i set my bot to do price + 4.9% instead

[01-Aug-19 11:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now i am the guy making 5% and i see this guy under cutting me, i either find another pair that the 4.9 guy is not doing or  i under cut him 4.8%

[01-Aug-19 11:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now image we have instead of 2 people we have 200 people under cutting each other to get the free money

[01-Aug-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The market will then figure out who will keep providing the liquidity at the lowest fee  and there will be a balance

[01-Aug-19 11:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is like the bitcoin hash rate going up. For a period of time when the hash is too high and profits not enough to justify it, some miners back off so the remaining miners get more, then when it is profitable again they jump back in. Market will self regulate

[01-Aug-19 11:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But at the end of the day, we will be the most liquid DEX ever.

[02-Aug-19 08:27 AM] OrgiOrg#1001

[02-Aug-19 08:21 PM] yorklab#7270
@DmitriyIvanov2405, Ask in #atomicdex-beta .

[02-Aug-19 08:32 PM] crumb#2550
are there specific plans in place to have good liquidity for when AtomicDEX is out and usable for everyone? i read that there are plans to use CEX API-s to enable more liquidity. is that for some more distant future or will this be ready once AtomicDEX is launched?
so basically what i'm asking is: what specific steps are being taken to provide as much liquidity as possible?

[02-Aug-19 11:54 PM] yorklab#7270
If 5 different projects are using the AtomicDEX backend for their own DEX, is KMD given the same 10% discount automatically or can they choose not to use the discount?

[03-Aug-19 10:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@crumb afaik, marketmakers via CLI can already integrate CEX APIs if they code in the neccessary calls to replenish their funds after an order has matched. I'll be testing this myself using python next week.
@yorklab I guess certain 3rd party projects may decide to not pass on the discount, but that would meke them less competitive so it would be a silly thing to do.

[03-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
discounted fee is part of the protocol

[03-Aug-19 10:46 AM] crumb#2550
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator my question was not **if** those things could be done, but more about if there are arrangements/deals with parties in place to provide more liquidity

[03-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
we are creating automated marketmakers anybody can use

[03-Aug-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
not involved on the deal side, but i heard some potential deals are also in the works, but of course that relies on third parties. when everybody can be a marketmaker and make relatively risk free 5% arbitrage, i think that since people like money, we will get people to do that

[03-Aug-19 10:51 AM] crumb#2550
marketing/PR/communications team should prepare articles and guides to make this as easy as possible and shout it from the rooftops. this kind of stuff is gold for social media efforts

[03-Aug-19 10:52 AM] crumb#2550
tech has never been an issue in KMD ecosystem 😄

[03-Aug-19 01:19 PM] willofleo#7505
will atomic dex be able to include large corporate  coins like "libra" this would bring in volume on a large scale

[03-Aug-19 01:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
if they can do atomic swaps

[03-Aug-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
but they can freeze any transaction or even undo it right? so that seems not a good idea as it breaks the "atomic" property

[03-Aug-19 01:22 PM] willofleo#7505
so if it possible still .a no?

[03-Aug-19 01:24 PM] willofleo#7505
assuming they dont break atomic property

[03-Aug-19 01:28 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
imagine , your trade with libra is completed, you sent your kmd, you received libra. Then they decided to reverse libra transaction. Now your libra is gone, your kmd is gone.

[03-Aug-19 01:30 PM] willofleo#7505
@Gordon Komodo  that fine if people still want to trade regardless they shouldn't be stopped

[03-Aug-19 01:31 PM] willofleo#7505
both parties have agreed with the consequence by choosing to trade

[03-Aug-19 01:31 PM] willofleo#7505
however in terms of volume this can be huge volume added

[03-Aug-19 01:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@willofleo this is a open protocol
even if the team doesn't add it to atomicDEX, someone else can add it to their GUI

ok , any gui that has this will absolutely  have more volume than those without

[03-Aug-19 08:36 PM] 27aume#8635
Well that volume will only concern libra, not the whole network liquidity. It would only be usefull for rankings like cmc. If you trade notLibra to notLibra this volume isnt really usefull at all. Maybe im wrong.

[03-Aug-19 08:36 PM] 27aume#8635
By libra i include similars project/assets

[03-Aug-19 09:05 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477

Since grandma tends to think in terms of fiat values, can/will the order book be displayed and interacted with in the fiat of choice? Such that if grandma wants to sell $10 of crypto she lists it as $10, irrespective of whether $10 of KMD is 1 KMD or .1 KMD. Asking for a grandma.

At the moment dex doesn’t look good from the ux/ui, design point of view + there are bugs and errors in place which are to be fixed i assume.  Looking at dex now i don’t see many users using it + i am sure we will face liquidity issues (remember first dex which was used by few ppl only and was not popular at all). What is the plan? When are you planning to polish product and make it public? Will the community see marketing plan?

[07-Aug-19 04:06 PM] Buddz1993#5380
mm 2.0 should fix those issues with liquidity

@Buddz1993 just to be precise, MM2 in itself will not solve liquidity issues. it will improve the UX

[07-Aug-19 04:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380

Please tell me the your atomic dex is instant or take time for exchage ,transfer and swaps

order matching is instant, swap time depends on blockchain confirmations (for example a swap involving btc is slower )

Do we have access to our private keys from the wallet?

[07-Aug-19 05:05 PM] Audo#5667
yes, the seed you use can be transformed into a privatekey format. The seed is also compatible with Verus Agama (for example)

[07-Aug-19 05:06 PM] ca333#0118
and it is accessible from within atomicDEX mobile - visit Settings->View Seed

[07-Aug-19 05:08 PM] cyrelb#6993
But for BTC for example? Do we have to install Verus Agam and the PK is derived from the seed?

[07-Aug-19 05:08 PM] Camilo Lopez#8651
Can you do offchain swaps orders? Because you need internet access to executed the swap. What about be able to open an order offline and execute after been online.

[07-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Smedley#8094
Will coin communities that have a big userbase but lack being a base trading pair on exchanges be contacted to possibly create their own version of atomicdex with their coin as a base pairing? Coins such as dash or dogecoin. This could set the Komodo atomic swap protocol as the baseline of atomic swaps bringing more people into the komodo ecosystem.

[07-Aug-19 05:13 PM] alperC#7758
@cyrelb so you asking if you can access your key for a specific coin ?

[07-Aug-19 05:16 PM] ca333#0118
There are many options to transform the Seed to any coins private key in the wallet import format. I believe Verus Agama has this feature. There are many other tools available (like https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39) for this task since we follow the BIP39 standard @cyrelb -  https://github.com/DeckerSU/address_gen is an option which is trusted and Agama seed compatible.
