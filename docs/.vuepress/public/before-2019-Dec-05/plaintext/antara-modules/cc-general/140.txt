PirateNetwork/komodo `FSM` and jl777/komodo `FSM` are exactly same except of last commit

[03-Dec-18 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
And in last commit only timestamps changed

So only difference is that I'm using jl777/FSM and you're PirateNetwork/FSM

[03-Dec-18 12:38 PM] SHossain#0007
yes. i'm using PirateNetwork/FSM

[03-Dec-18 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
with NO manual modification locally

[03-Dec-18 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
just pure FSM from there

[03-Dec-18 12:39 PM] SHossain#0007
unless PirateNetwork/FSM is malformed with the changes

On PirateNetwork/FSM I did same sequence of actions as on jl777/FSM  but get and error on `oraclesdata` tx broadcasting:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=SPLTEST oraclesdata sendrawtransaction hexoforaclesdata

[03-Dec-18 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain could you please check the same on jl777/FSM with timestamps changed in `komodo_defs` on prebuild?

[03-Dec-18 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
If it'll work for you fine same as for me I guess that's mean that something was corrupted on merge of things from jl777 to PirateNetwork

[03-Dec-18 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. testing

@cipi Hmm I saw similar errors when I've tried to start komodod when concurrent komodod processes were started in system and stopping all these other komodod processes helped

[03-Dec-18 01:42 PM] cipi#4502
can't stop the others, it is on the SPV servers, the other processes are needed for the others assetchains

[03-Dec-18 01:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL @jl777c tested the jl777/FSM branch with custom timestamp and `oraclesdata` worked fine without any issues 🤔

@cipi  seen that before, reindex fixes it, or use a.bootstrap of chain data.

@blackjok3r ill try and reindex PN chain thenm

Maybe that crash was an edge case that's now more prevalent?

[03-Dec-18 02:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It usually happened on low memory systems for us, months ago now, we just told everyone to use a.bootstrap on low ram systems.

the different results with what should be the same source base, indicates maybe the exact precise state of the utxo is what is affecting things

[03-Dec-18 04:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL nice PR!! I think that will help us going forward, as we add lots of tests to each

[03-Dec-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
merged

[04-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Alright#0419
@SHossain oraclesdata consistently works the first couple times

[04-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL `datafee 0.00000000 is illegal` typically means your node can't find oraclessubscribe utxos

[04-Dec-18 12:21 AM] SHossain#0007
Mihailo should be back tomorrow and will have a look at this issue.

[04-Dec-18 12:47 AM] Alright#0419
Did you have the same experience as me? It'll work 2-3 times with a new pubkey then start throwing stack element errors?

[04-Dec-18 06:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @dukeleto ! More cool things coming 👍 
@Alright on jl777/FSM it's worked as expected for me - can send as many `oraclesdata` as UTXOs I have in each block. on PirateNetwork/FSM I can't send even 1 `oraclesdata` with `datafee 0.00000000 is illegal`

[04-Dec-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so its sapling activation that broke it ?

[04-Dec-18 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
No, sapling is activated on both (for jl777/FSM it was activated manually by sapling activation timestamps changing in `komodo_defs` to the same as PirateNetwork) and it's the same chain

[04-Dec-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes buyt if you change the timestamps sapling actaully activates

[04-Dec-18 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is the only diffrence

[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I found tetsting pool earlier

[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it uses the first time stamp, to calculate the block height it will activate at

[04-Dec-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but then doesnt actually activate until where it expects the second timestamp to occur (as a block height)

[04-Dec-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so using jl777 branch ]

[04-Dec-18 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
nothing is acrtivated until Feb

[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hey guys, I'm back... I'm reading what you wrote about the problem with oracles. So now when @blackjok3r wrote that it could be that jl777 FSM branch does not have sapling activated, can some one guide me how to check this (not so familiar with sapling changes)? If sapling is causing this bug with oracles, maybe it will be straight forward to find it...

[04-Dec-18 09:27 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Hi! Welcome back! Hope everything is well.

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r jl777/FSM  was built by me and @SHossain with custom timestamps in komodod_defs (same as PirateNetwork repo have) - with default timestamps you'll not able even sync SPLTEST because sapling is activated on it

[04-Dec-18 09:29 AM] Mihailo#5902
Hi, thnx. It's ok 😉

[04-Dec-18 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Welcome back! To prepare jl777/FSM komodod which is ready for sapling - before building you have to change timestamps in this file: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/komodo_defs.h
For some in the past - for example same as these ones: https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo/blob/FSM/src/komodo_defs.h

[04-Dec-18 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
After it you should be able to sync sapling activated chain `SPLTEST` or start your very own sapling activated chain

[04-Dec-18 09:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL Ok, got it. But just wanted to see is there a way to confirm what @blackjok3r wrote, that sapling may not be active just with timestamps? But as you wrote it probably would not sync the chain if it isn't active...

[04-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
Forget that, read it wrongly.... Ok, I'll sync SPLTEST and check the oracles, and try with Pirate also...

[04-Dec-18 09:39 AM] Mihailo#5902
Is there bootstrap for Pirate somewhere so that I do not have to sync the whole chain?

[04-Dec-18 09:59 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo before meant not Pirate chain but PirateNetwork repo ( https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo)

[04-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, yep. Just the changes from their repo....

[04-Dec-18 09:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Both PirateNetwork/komodo FSM and jl777/komodo FSM were tested on same SPLTEST chain

[04-Dec-18 10:00 AM] TonyL#3577
And results were confusing because repos looks like exactly same

[04-Dec-18 10:00 AM] TonyL#3577
You can ensure if sapling activated if transaction `version` is 4

[04-Dec-18 10:00 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, I'm just having an idea that it might be that old oracles which were created before sapling activated could cause problems when sapling is active. Have you tried with fresh oracle when sapling is activated?

[04-Dec-18 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, all tests we did on fresh oracles

[04-Dec-18 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
And sapling was activated from start on SPLTEST

[04-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, and code from Pirate repo has the bug but FSM does not have it?

[04-Dec-18 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, same thing not works with komodod from pirate repo FSM when works fine on komodod from jl777 FSM

[04-Dec-18 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Flow is: 1) Create oracle, 2) Register twice 3) Subscribe twice

[04-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, and if you register once then it does not happen?

[04-Dec-18 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Then you'll able to send `oraclesdata` on jl777 but on PirateNetwork it'll return error `datafee 0.00000000 is illegal`

[04-Dec-18 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh it's a good question actually

[04-Dec-18 10:06 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, lets break it down. So we have two issues. One is datafee 0 illegal and one is AcceptToMemoryPool: ConnectInputs failed.

[04-Dec-18 10:06 AM] Mihailo#5902
Both of them happens only on Pirate FSM branch.

[04-Dec-18 10:06 AM] Mihailo#5902
Steps to reproduce for each are?

[04-Dec-18 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
I was able to reproduce only issue with `datafee 0 illegal`
Exact steps to reproduce:
1) Create an oracle with S type
2) Register twice with datafee 10000 sat
3) Subscribe twice with fee 1 coin
4) Try to brodcast any `oraclesdata`

[04-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Mihailo#5902
Good, let's address this one first

[04-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Mihailo#5902
I'll try it on my fresh chain and on SPLTEST to see if I can reproduce on both.

[04-Dec-18 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto Hmm, made a mechanism to connect external servers by RPC credentials in case of `--remoteserver` param.
But issue atm is that all tests which we have using regtest `generate` mechanics :(
```PYTHON_DEBUG=1  qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.sh cryptoconditions_dice --remoteserver

Maybe create custom generate to change existing one - if `--remoteserver` it'll wait for X blocks instead of execute regtest only call `generate` and if  `--remoteserver` no need to pre-generate 100 blocks

[04-Dec-18 10:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
I have started fresh chain on jl777 FSM, and created oracle and everything went good. But when I used Pirate repo and started the daemon I noticed this in output:
```
ORACLEBUG transition at 1 (0, 1231006505) -> (1, 1543918534)
SET SAPLING ACTIVATION height.61
ORACLEBUG sapling activation at 61
```

[04-Dec-18 10:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
I think I have not seen this when using jl FSM. And now I cannot send oraclesdata

[04-Dec-18 10:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
So I've done all oracle stuff before height 61

[04-Dec-18 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
With JL FSM I guess you used default `komodo_defs` so sapling wasn't activated

[04-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
No, I changed komodo_defs to pirate numbers

[04-Dec-18 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm strange so:
```SET SAPLING ACTIVATION height.61
ORACLEBUG sapling activation at 61```
These prints just means that sapling will be activated on height 61

[04-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, so I think I did not have sapling activated when using jl FSM

[04-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, it seems I have been using jl FSM all the time...

[04-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
as I have that repo src in PATH
