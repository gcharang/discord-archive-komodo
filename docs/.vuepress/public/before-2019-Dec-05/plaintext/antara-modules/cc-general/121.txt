Want to be clear on this pubkey rpc. in what instances/situations I should avoid using this rpc?

[24-Oct-18 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for example the trsansaction sending is in progress, I should not issue this rpc.

[24-Oct-18 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that I understand

[24-Oct-18 12:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but dosn't other rpc wait to respond while one rpc is in progress?

[24-Oct-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You should ONLY use directly after starting the daemon... it replaces using the -pubkey and adds extra checks to stop you using an invalid pubkey.

[24-Oct-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and will also report if the pubkey/raddress is imported to the local wallet

[24-Oct-18 12:15 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its realy for CC contracts.

[24-Oct-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
start daemon, generate new address or retreive a valid pubey from wallet then set the pubkey.

[24-Oct-18 12:16 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it should not be used for anything else.

[24-Oct-18 12:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
once your use it once the pubkey is then set and you need to reatrt daemon to change it as usual.

[24-Oct-18 12:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool
thanks for clearing 👍

Get sick a little bit so wasn't active for a last two days :/ Now feel better, hehe 🙌 
I've swiped previous code in this repo: https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui since it's working bad and not flexible at all 
Now trying to make this TUI less cashable, work with multisig gateways and working with RPC not via komodo-cli calls this time. Made initial commit to demonstrate the usage with RPC lib on token creation example. 
As the most simple solution it's just asking for RPC connection details on start.

Flow is -> there is a `rpclib` which will have a library for RPC calls built on top of `python-bitcoinrpc` package, `tuilib` building on top of `rpclib` to add needed input asking/printouts, `TUI` itself working with `tuilib`

[25-Oct-18 07:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL I have a suggestion regarding gateways tui: 
Create 3 different tui: 
 1) for creating represenatative token onchain, create oracle, bind them to gateway... so on... that are the duty of one of the trusted `MofN` fedaration
2) for the gateways user who wants to deposit external coins
3)for the gateways user who has onchain tokens and wants to withdraw external tokens

A script that deals with onchain trade might be good too.

I am not asking for this right away, but this could be the final structure to go for that will make it more understandable to dAPP devs

[25-Oct-18 09:57 PM] TonyL#3577
@gcharang Thanks for suggestion!
Previous one combined all of these but you have to know what you do. Seems like a good idea to separate for gateway operator and gateway user (at least make two modes / menus in same tool)
I've started to struggle with this framework to make GUI of TUI better: https://github.com/npcole/npyscreen
But it's quite hard for me so far since I have no experience with OOP and MVC stuff. With this framework possible to create sub-menus, mouse-support, multi-screens, user can choose path to needed config graphically and a lot of stuff on top of ncurses

Will follow @gcharang suggestion and separate gateway operator and user parts:
Gateways creating process seems to be covered (let's call it an operator part): 
https://github.com/tonymorony/cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/gateways_tui.py
This time I've added more validations (e.g. you'll be notified if oracle, token and coin ticker names aren't equal) and also multisig should be supported since it's working with custom M N.
Would be great if someone test on his side for gateway creating process @Mihailo @SHossain or anyone else

Yep, just one withdraw to let nodes sign it when all of them are running. i did it one by one

Fixed TUI `gatewaysbind` for M N > 1 (was a little bit tricky since gatewaysbind receiving pubkeys not as array but as separate parameters)

hi all))
i have started the node with params:
```
./src/komodod -ac_cc=1 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -pubkey=02234de1d05bc694d23bbc378dc00f327ed4b9db6b55464bd98617523b34d653e9 -addnode=78.47.196.146 -daemon
```
and now try to run faucet cc:
```
./src/komodo-cli faucetinfo
```
the response says the funding is zero
please advise where I am wrong to run the faucet cc?

[30-Oct-18 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt look like you set any chain name or parameters?

[30-Oct-18 09:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
surprised it works at all tbh

[30-Oct-18 10:06 AM] xbis#8594
I was not trying to create a new assetchain but use the KMD

[30-Oct-18 10:07 AM] xbis#8594
is it possible?

[30-Oct-18 10:08 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ther are no CC on KMD itself

[30-Oct-18 10:11 AM] xbis#8594
so i have to run 2 nodes and activate new assetchain?

[30-Oct-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
No just use an assetrchins with a faucet... KMDICE has a faucet

[30-Oct-18 10:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
check `komodo/src/assetchains.old` for the start parameter

[30-Oct-18 02:18 PM] xbis#8594
started with 
```
./src/komodod -pubkey=02234de1d05bc694d23bbc378dc00f327ed4b9db6b55464bd98617523b34d653e9 -ac_cc=1 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_name=KMDICE -addnode=78.47.196.146

but:
```
./src/komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE faucetinfo
{
  "result": "success",
  "name": "Faucet",
  "funding": "0.00000000"

shall I connect to another node? I could not find KMDICE start params in the assetchains.old ((

[31-Oct-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im trying to register to an oracle i made on KMDICE

[31-Oct-18 01:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
this is the oracle: ```/komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE oraclesinfo 322dd0c55601f3e459bb78f2a5dcf202d4de851fd6e20629b4c489284712076f

how much funds do you have in your -pubkey address

maybe specify it in satoshis

it does seem it should be in coins ,not sure why it is silly

[31-Oct-18 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep, at the moment registration datafee is in satoshies but subscription fee is in coins

[31-Oct-18 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems wrong

[31-Oct-18 01:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Highlighted it in latest TUI but first version robbed people 😃

[31-Oct-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if this is changed then everything that uses it needs to be changed...

[31-Oct-18 01:44 PM] TonyL#3577
So best time to change it is yesterday while not much dAPPs built on top of it 😃

[31-Oct-18 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets ask @Mihailo  to do this 😃

[31-Oct-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are ok with forcing datafee > 1.0 to use satoshis, I can make it so anything less than 1.0 uses floating point

[31-Oct-18 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it ok by consensus to make both in satoshies? I think in such way people definitely will know what they do when sending fee and add a lot of zeros

[31-Oct-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a mostly backward compatible fix

[31-Oct-18 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if floating point fee < 1.0 is used, it is parsed as floating point

👌 

[31-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @jl777c  I have added this issue in my to-do. The only reason I have not done it yet is that oracles is used already in some AC so we need to notify others about this, so I pushed it in a queue 😉

[31-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
my fix should work for all usages where datafee is less than 100 million sats

is this conversion correct for using it on the hexstring? ```echo 537 | xxd -b -p
