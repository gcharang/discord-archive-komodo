what should i take

[16-Jul-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
verus or ocean are from the komodo community

[16-Jul-19 07:03 PM] jorian#4555
guarda is 3rd party, don't have much experience, maybe ask in #talk-trading

[16-Jul-19 07:04 PM] jorian#4555
never heard of zel

[16-Jul-19 07:04 PM] Julia#2161
zei is listed in the website of komodo

[16-Jul-19 07:05 PM] Julia#2161
i take versus, it's written there that it's a multicoin wallet

[16-Jul-19 07:05 PM] jorian#4555
yes, can't go wrong with that

Hi,
I'm looking for information related to tokenizing realty. Found a bit on assets.cc.
I apologize for not doing more research before asking here. I'm just running out of time.
I'd be grateful for any links and Information that you could share. 🙏

@CrisF about the 4th tutorial in you can make tokens in a docker environment

[17-Jul-19 02:11 AM] Mylo#8306
start on 👆  that link and follow next page til you hit "beginner series: Understanding tokens"

[17-Jul-19 02:48 AM] CrisF#3405
OK, great, thanks @Mylo !

[17-Jul-19 02:50 AM] CrisF#3405
It's not for me.  I have someone I'd like to show. They consulting on a project using another platform to do this.

[17-Jul-19 02:50 AM] CrisF#3405
Plant a seed and see what comes from it.

[17-Jul-19 03:20 AM] CrisF#3405
@Mylo the documentation is really becoming amazing, eh!
If there's anything else, technical and non-, happy to hear of it.

[17-Jul-19 08:07 AM] Mylo#8306
That is @Bryan_Beus ‘S voice on @gcharang @Alright @dimxy and probably artem, artem shossain & jl + a few others work.  I may have planted a little seed with the tool and contributed but definitely most of the heavy lifting was a team effort

[17-Jul-19 01:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@CrisF 

We have documentation coming on the Assets Antara Module. This module allows for token trading on a chain.

The first draft is finished (by gcharang), and now I need to edit.  Check back in a week or two and we should have it online. Feel free to message me, if needed.

Thanks @Bryan_Beus , that will be very useful 🙏 
I'd like to give them an option for tokenizing and see what happens from there.

Good morning @bubu have a nice day too ! ☕

[07-Aug-19 08:24 AM] ERIC#3057
I have add a new token Antara module to my smart chain .  After I restart my nodes, all my previous blocks have lost.  Any one know what is the problem ?

[07-Aug-19 08:27 AM] gcharang#6833
please make sure the launch parameters are exactly the same as the previous time
changing just one parameter's inclusion or value will create a new chain with the same name

[07-Aug-19 08:30 AM] ERIC#3057
Does that mean each time I want to add an Antara module, I will get a new chain. Can't I use the old chain to support a new Antara module ?

[07-Aug-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to make source level changes to do that

[07-Aug-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810

[07-Aug-19 08:38 AM] ERIC#3057
I see. Thanks

[07-Aug-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
or just activate all the ones you plan to use. make sure it all works as you expect in testing and then whenever new ones are used, they will be accepted by the same chain.

hello

[08-Sep-19 07:44 PM] Hooftly#1337
Hey there im looking into Smart Chains and I have a question.  It seems from the code that `-ac_private` for total privacy is not supported and users are instead directed to use PIRATE instead.  Does that mean to make a Smart Chain using Pirate to achieve total privacy or is it suggesting you just use the Currency ARRR Instead?

```
fprintf(stderr,"-ac_private for a non-PIRATE chain is not supported. The only reason to have an -ac_private chain is for total privacy and that is best achieved with the largest anon set. PIRATE has that and it is recommended to just use PIRATE\n");
            StartShutdown();
```

[08-Sep-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
for privacy, it needs to have the largest anon set and with almost a year head start PIRATE has the largest anon set of all zcash coins, something like 30x what zcash ZEC itself has

[08-Sep-19 07:47 PM] jl777c#5810
by making a private chain, you lose the ability of taddr, including CC, so it is really not a very useful chain to make it a private chain with a small anon set, ie. not very private and cant do anything else

[08-Sep-19 07:49 PM] Hooftly#1337
I Understand that but there is ways to get a community together to increase that set like the Church of Monero does.  I guess a Smart Chain is gonna be a hard sell for what i am trying to do

[11-Sep-19 03:51 PM] papacabeza#1885
Hi @jl777c I'm leading a zero-premine academic-focused research project (with mostly anonymous/pseudonymous members)  One of our researchers @Hooftly, our project tech lead.  We have a junior high researcher involved, too (that particular researcher is my daughter). 🙂  *Question:* we're doing a live crypto project (academic and public policy focus, but it's real crypto) and will hack at this for a while.  Our project researchers are settling in on a Smart Chain as the long-term place for us.  Wanted to understand pricing and cost, and if you have early discounts for projects like ours.  Happy to post links but I don't want to get banned for spamming. 🙂

[11-Sep-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you setup the chains yourself, there is no cost

[11-Sep-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
for dPoW would there be a cost, but for most research things dPoW wouldnt be needed

[11-Sep-19 03:54 PM] papacabeza#1885
One of the things we want to include in our research (down the line) is resilience testing and even open "try and hack us" kind of academic competitions (with prizes).  That's all down the line.  But because we want to build a chain to test on we do want dPoW.  How could we estimate a cost for that (@Hooftly will handle the chain setup)

[11-Sep-19 03:56 PM] papacabeza#1885
Also btw @jl777c you should know that your PoS options are what really caught our attention because my daughter has required as part of the project design criteria that we have a primarily PoS system (for environmental reasons).  It's speaking to the next generation. 🙂

[11-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Hooftly#1337
We would like to set up an Antara Smart Chain that is Mostly PoS and part PoW utilizing the CC Modules and secured by dPoW

[11-Sep-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i would suggest to use -ac_adaptivepow=1 instead of PoS, as it allows CPU mining to coexist with on/off ASIC mining

[11-Sep-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
for a purely academic project, we can likely offer dPoW notarization probono if you do all the chain setup yourself

[11-Sep-19 04:03 PM] papacabeza#1885
@jl777c that's really interesting about CPU vs PoS.  I'll run that by her.  I'd love to try and see if we can find some ways to quantify the environmental impact of those tradeoffs . . . I'll look into that.  *Very cool* of you to offer notarization.  We'd love to share what we do (as we do it) to help showcase our project.

[11-Sep-19 04:08 PM] papacabeza#1885
@jl777c she wanted to do 90% PoS, 10% PoW (there was a variable description in docs indicating that might be possible).  Is it possible to do 90% PoS and 10% adapativepow?  She wants to build Raspberry Pi nodes that can meaningfully mine (the Raspberry Pi is the computer of choice for junior high hackers), and figured that they would be most efficient if set up as mini PoS nodes.

[11-Sep-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
CPU mining is very environment friendly and we have it where a single CPU can mine blocks even after an ASIC has been mining

[11-Sep-19 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the behavior of a 100% PoW chain will be much more stable and easier to manage than a high percentage PoS chain, with a high percentage PoS chain, everything is dependent on how the premine is allocated. it is not a very decentralized system

[11-Sep-19 04:09 PM] papacabeza#1885
Great input.  I'll bring this to her.

[11-Sep-19 04:10 PM] Hooftly#1337
Coins would need to be staked before block 100 is how I understand it

[11-Sep-19 04:10 PM] Hooftly#1337
on a number of nodes

[11-Sep-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
with PoS you would need to distribute the premine before block 100 and have enough nodes staking to make sure the chain advances

[11-Sep-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
with adaptivePoW, none of that is needed. just start the chain and whatever amount of mining nodes you have, it will advance the chain, even if there is only one core mining in the entire network

[11-Sep-19 04:20 PM] Hooftly#1337
Thanks for the advice.

Understood I realize maintenance is required and what is needed if they decide to go ahead with a heavy PoS chain.

[11-Sep-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
its just easy to botch a high percentage PoS chain and forever it will depend on the initial premine allocation

[11-Sep-19 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
a much better distribution and less issues with 100% adaptivepow

[11-Sep-19 04:33 PM] papacabeza#1885
We don't have a premine per se but we do have an active chain that we're swapping over, and the "dev wallet" from mining should give us enough to start nodes.  Really good advice on the emphasis on adaptive PoW . . . but we also want the learning/hacking how-is-network-different research opportunity with PoS.  So maybe a mix of some kind?

[11-Sep-19 04:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you can run two chains and see how they compare

[11-Sep-19 04:53 PM] Hooftly#1337
Hmm perhaps one purely PoW and one that is heavier PoS (maybe not 90% ) and we could use CC to have them interact with eachother

[11-Sep-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
make a two chain cluster, you wont be able to do cross chain until notairzations start, but that would be a cool pair of chains

[11-Sep-19 05:09 PM] Hooftly#1337
Yeah I like this idea.  And for research purposes you can analyze impact of both chains.

[16-Sep-19 03:24 PM] Hooftly#1337
Is it ok to ask for a push in the right direction here regarding starting a new Smart Chain and RPC issues?  I cannot seem to access the RPC port via komodo-cli.  I am using the ac_name rpc-port and conf flags.  Its probably something stupid simple im overlooking.

Note I am using the dev branch to utilize Adaptivepow

[16-Sep-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
what specific command is getting what specific error?

[16-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Hooftly#1337
Command: 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=assestchain -rpc-port=19690 -conf=/home/ubuntu/.komodo/assetchain/assetchain.conf setgenerate true
``` 

Error:

[16-Sep-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the rpcport in the getinfo output?

[16-Sep-19 04:10 PM] Hooftly#1337
Command:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=assetchain -rpc-port=19690 getinfo
```

Output:
```
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)
```

Note When starting the Chain on 4 nodes I was given this:
```
>>>>>>>>>> assetchain: p2p.19689 rpc.19690 magic.46bee181 1186914689 315000 coins
```

Just trying to get it started now but RPC wont listen lol

[16-Sep-19 04:14 PM] Hooftly#1337

```
-ac_supply -ac_adaptivepow -ac_blocktime -ac_cbmaturity -ac_cc -ac_ccactivate -ac_eras -ac_reward -ac_end -ac_staked

[16-Sep-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=assetchain  getinfo

[16-Sep-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
does that work?

[16-Sep-19 04:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont need to set the rpcport in the cli unless you are using non-standard

[16-Sep-19 04:38 PM] Hooftly#1337
no same error unfortunately

[16-Sep-19 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
how exactly did you start the chain?

[16-Sep-19 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
once a chain is started, just doing a ./komodo-cli -ac_name=<NAME> getinfo should just work

[16-Sep-19 05:50 PM] Hooftly#1337
@jl777c Below is the exact command I used on 4 nodes and none have access to RPC able to return `./komodo-cli -ac_name=assetchain getinfo` information.  The same error above occurs.
```
./komodod -ac_name=assetchain -ac_supply=315000 -ac_adaptivepow=1 -ac_blocktime=60 -ac_cbmaturity=12 -ac_cc=2019 =ac_ccactivate=1000 -ac_eras=5 -ac_reward=115000000,8800000,4200000,1800000,1250000 -ac_end=525600,1051200,1576800,1680481,19867680 -ac_staked=50 -add-node=. . .
```

[16-Sep-19 05:52 PM] Hooftly#1337
Im starting to feel like its not something I am doing LOL 😄

[16-Sep-19 05:53 PM] cipi#4502
is the daemon really listening to that port?
`netstat -ntlp | grep 19690`

[16-Sep-19 05:54 PM] cipi#4502
could it be that the port is already in use by something else?
`netstat -natp | grep 19690`

[16-Sep-19 05:59 PM] jl777c#5810
@Hooftly it looks fine, @gcharang plz help with this, maybe you can launch that chain and make sure the rpc works

[16-Sep-19 06:05 PM] Hooftly#1337
@cipi hmm its not listening you are correct as netsat returns no response

[16-Sep-19 06:06 PM] Hooftly#1337
assetchain is not actually the name btw 😄

[16-Sep-19 06:07 PM] Hooftly#1337
its `ac_name=unicornis`

[16-Sep-19 06:11 PM] jorian#4555
`-add-node=` > `-addnode=`

[16-Sep-19 06:14 PM] jorian#4555
@Hooftly can you share a printscreen of what comes after you run `./komodod -ac_name=...` ?

[16-Sep-19 06:16 PM] Hooftly#1337
Yes I added the nodes I just didnt feel like sharing the Ip Addresses

[16-Sep-19 06:17 PM] Hooftly#1337
I cant share screens here

[16-Sep-19 06:17 PM] Hooftly#1337
@jorian

[16-Sep-19 06:18 PM] jorian#4555
no, but it's `addnode`, not `add-node`

[16-Sep-19 06:18 PM] jorian#4555
maybe that messes up a bit, no idea

[16-Sep-19 06:22 PM] Hooftly#1337
oh shit

[16-Sep-19 06:22 PM] Hooftly#1337
lets try

[16-Sep-19 06:22 PM] Hooftly#1337
If so lol

[16-Sep-19 06:24 PM] cipi#4502
btw, there is also an error in the paramater `=ac_ccactivate=1000`, it should be `-ac_ccactivate=1000`

[16-Sep-19 06:26 PM] Hooftly#1337
look at that lol

[16-Sep-19 06:28 PM] Hooftly#1337
So I nuked the asset chain folder and started again and made those changes to addnode and ccactivate and still the same result

[16-Sep-19 06:32 PM] cipi#4502
what does `netstat -ntlp | grep komodod`show? Does it listen to some other port instead?

that is the komodod for KMD, the other one is not listening to any port

[16-Sep-19 06:47 PM] cipi#4502
looks more like it didn't even start... `ps aux | grep komodod`

[16-Sep-19 06:48 PM] jorian#4555
hence my question of sharing a printscreen of the exact output
