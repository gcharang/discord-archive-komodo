@TonyL did the cclib RPC command change

[30-Jan-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
what are you passing to `cclib` rpc?

[30-Jan-19 06:38 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm passing RPC arguments - it's quite same. For example to get list of pending puzzles: ``` pending_puzzles = rpc_connection.cclib("pending", "17")["pending"]
```

[30-Jan-19 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
./komodo-cli -ac_name=CLIB cclib faucet2_fund "["10"]"
this is what it use to be

[30-Jan-19 06:40 PM] Alright#0419
trying to figure out what the equivalent is now. I see that cclibinfo output changed and the methods are now separated from contract name

[30-Jan-19 06:41 PM] Alright#0419
`cclib "pending" "17"` ?

[30-Jan-19 06:42 PM] TonyL#3577
In cli it's `./komodo-cli -ac_name=SUDOKU cclib "pending" 17`

[30-Jan-19 06:42 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand the list following where you called the function. Is that the response?

[30-Jan-19 06:42 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=SUDOKU cclib "txidinfo" 17 \"5d13c1ad80daf37215c74809a36720c2ada90bacadb2e10bf0866092ce558432\"```
17 is evalcode

[30-Jan-19 06:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Which list?

[30-Jan-19 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
rpc_connection.cclib("pending", "17")`["pending"]`

[30-Jan-19 06:43 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm taking the key "pending" from dictionary

[30-Jan-19 06:43 PM] TonyL#3577
```test = { "a" : 1, "b" : 2}
test1 = test["b"]
2```

[30-Jan-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
ah the result of the function is dict than "pending" is value?

[30-Jan-19 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
didn't realize you could do it like that

[30-Jan-19 06:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes it returning JSON and pending transactions are in `pending` key

[30-Jan-19 06:46 PM] Alright#0419
```
blah = rpc_connection.cclib("pending", "17")
pending_puzzles = blah["pending"]

[30-Jan-19 06:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep

Btw it's not so easy to connect automated solver even with current protection

[30-Jan-19 06:49 PM] TonyL#3577
There are tricky moments - especially when will be enabled full validation. That's why I have a dynamically updating dictionary where keys are cells numbers from 1 to 81 and values are timestamps from keyboard valid key input handler

So possible to make CFEK super custom skin

[30-Jan-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I just picked 60000 for a clusterid

[30-Jan-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i added support for multiple evalcodes, so I needed something other than faucet2 and didnt want to be lame and make faucet3

[30-Jan-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so I combined a gamified blockchain and made SUDOKU.

[30-Jan-19 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
with the timestamps, we should be able to get a decent captcha, but I need a few dozen actually human solve times to train the AI with, hundreds would be better

[30-Jan-19 08:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe make some solving competion with screen streaming let's say on Twitch?

[30-Jan-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so when this is all working, it will be a gamified chain that is basically its own automated entity as it is an ac_perc chain, so as people solve puzzles new puzzles can be created. It will also create a database of sudoku solve timestamps to be useful for captcha pattern recognition

[30-Jan-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and the rich list will be the top sudoku solver list

[30-Jan-19 08:35 PM] TonyL#3577
To get more these human times

[30-Jan-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
so it has the multifaceted purpose

[30-Jan-19 08:36 PM] jl777c#5810
I came up with another game I can put into the blockchain,but not sure yet if it will make sense.  I guess it can be a race for people to solve the same game, which turns what is otherwise a solitaire game into a multiplayer, even though there is no direct interaction

[30-Jan-19 08:37 PM] jl777c#5810
once all the sudoku are solved, then issuing a single one with multiple players turns it into a competitive race, but before we can have any much value to SUDOKU coins, we need the timestamp data
