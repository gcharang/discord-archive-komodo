Try to call ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22c107aa7bb06c4548e0fc1e8453172b75bef5fc59ee4a043dff6191849c1cb954%22]\"

[27-Feb-19 08:15 PM] TonyL#3577
There is only txid of game but no txid of bailout, anyway if other games worked - maybe everything is not so bad now 😃

[27-Feb-19 08:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Hope there will be 25 heroes for this open testing and we'll find some bugs

🤦 😔 

[27-Feb-19 11:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is the Game txid the same at the end as the begining?

[27-Feb-19 11:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
theres only one right?

[27-Feb-19 11:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes gametxid is the same in beginning and in bailout print in the end

[27-Feb-19 11:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Do we need to make it to level 12 to count as valid?

[27-Feb-19 11:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
3 games with a fresh warrior to level 12 is only for the very skilled

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] TonyL#3577
```3 - Play 3 long games (dungeon lvl12+) with fresh warrior or warrior re-usage and check if progress saves```

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Re-usage is ok

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If we're testing that bug we might need to save and go back a few times.

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Just need to check progress in long games

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ah ok

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ill have to redo some of these.

[27-Feb-19 11:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
sorry to hear that!

[28-Feb-19 12:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm going to re-write the post a bit @TonyL  
Also do you mind if we move the time line to end on the next day? It might be hard getting many people to do so many long games in that time frame

[28-Feb-19 12:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Sure 👍

[28-Feb-19 12:04 AM] TonyL#3577
You can set any timeframe you think correct

[28-Feb-19 12:11 AM] joe2x4#5987
just did a fresh install of ubuntu, then did the get started steps. tui option 6 produced the move ROGUE.conf error and wouldn'rt start so I used this comand cp ~/.komodo/ROGUE/ROGUE.conf ~/komodo/src    tui option 6 started a game this time. I killed one Emu, collected gold then got killed. game is stuck on this loop bailout not broadcasted yet by some reason. Let's wait...

Hmm, usually if bailout not broadcasting - it means that no keystroke transactions were sent or something like this

You may just `Ctrl+C` and restart TUI

[28-Feb-19 12:39 AM] joe2x4#5987
Do I need to Delete anything existing to make this work?

[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, just stop your current daemon, download and unzip bundle to some folder

[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
In zip there are komodod, rogue_tui, rogue - all necessary stuff

[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] joe2x4#5987
what is the correct way to stop daemon,

[28-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE stop`

"Mr. Mctesq" is a nickname of one of the creators, short for "Michael C. Toy, Esquire"

[28-Feb-19 02:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's good to leave so that is a tribute to the creators - just delete it seems kinda not very respectful

TUI just lost connection to daemon because daemon hanged

[28-Feb-19 03:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it happened in game or after you quit?

[28-Feb-19 03:54 AM] joe2x4#5987
after Q + y

[28-Feb-19 03:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so probably it's hang on bailout. Did you save the gametxid?

[28-Feb-19 03:56 AM] joe2x4#5987
```"gametxid":"4fa4b08afe0bd0fee9590554225e434474c2b4d735850760dfe26f250dffbd8e"```

[28-Feb-19 03:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to `pkill -9 komodod` to kill hanged daemon first

[28-Feb-19 03:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Then start daemon again and call ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%224fa4b08afe0bd0fee9590554225e434474c2b4d735850760dfe26f250dffbd8e%22]\"```

[28-Feb-19 03:57 AM] joe2x4#5987
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getbalance``` just hangs as well

[28-Feb-19 03:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Because your daemon in deadlock now

[28-Feb-19 03:57 AM] TonyL#3577
You have to restart it

[28-Feb-19 04:08 AM] TonyL#3577
@joe2x4 Is it possible to make bailout by ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%224fa4b08afe0bd0fee9590554225e434474c2b4d735850760dfe26f250dffbd8e%22]\"``` after restart or it hangs on it?
