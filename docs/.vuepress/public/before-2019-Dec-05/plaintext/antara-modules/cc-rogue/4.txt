@siu - Chainmakers check my guide in channel topic or pinned, follow the commands in exact order

[09-Feb-19 02:59 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to do `./makerogue` before compiling komodo

[09-Feb-19 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007
better to start with fresh clone

[09-Feb-19 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007

Not yet. Too tedious and not enough time :/

[09-Feb-19 04:03 PM] SHossain#0007
@Pumtchak you need to register new game each time after you die (for now)

[09-Feb-19 04:11 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
So from this game a type of blockchain based DOOM can be done? Or a Zelda game?

[09-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Alright#0419
@siu - Chainmakers if it's deterministically random

[09-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Alright#0419

[10-Feb-19 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
updated jl777 branch with new version. it works now much better and has nonfungible token data for the playerdata, also a new rpc "players" that will display all your players. you should be able to register with the playertxid and start the dungeon with that character. side effect is that all the magic is deciphered. if this makes the game too easy, I can make it so only things that are actually known can be seen

using the latest version, I am able to create a nonfungible asset, that theoretically can use the tokenbid/ask mechanism, though that needs to be verified. just got the basics working with the invaluable help of dimxy

[10-Feb-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
character data is creating the token when you 'Q', but not if you get killed

[10-Feb-19 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you can register with it and earlier I was able to play a new game with the playerdata, but i am waiting to mine a block to test it out

latest now works with playerdata. you can register the txid of the bailout assuming it has playerdata and then you can continue developing your character with the next game

[10-Feb-19 11:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it should also work with tokenbid/ask, but that definitely needs to be tested

[10-Feb-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
with this ROGUE is very close to feature complete. of course assuming no major bugs and the DEX functions work. I added some error checking, but I think it is still possible to end up in some bad states

it just prints an error

[11-Feb-19 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810

yes, i'm testing single player

To test:
```
git clone https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui 
cd komodo_cryptoconditions_tui
cp -r * ~/komodo/src
cd  ~/komodo/src
 ./rogue_tui.py ```

pip dependencies remained the same as before (can be found in repo readme). 
p.s. Your path to needed komodo might be different - it's just an example
p.p.s You need ROGUE daemon up
