those are some good points but it is the multichain compatibility that   pisses upon the competition from a great height. If a cosmos ecosystem product could atomically swap btc for eth, or even cosmos natively, it would be heralded as the second coming. Kmd's only real problem is that it's not holding hundreds of millions of ico funds and/or bagholders to throw at crypto carnival barkers. I hope maybe once the dex is out of beta some dev bandwidth can be more effectively pointed at cc origination, things will probably get a little easier to put together. defi is a giant buzzword now but if the price of eth is any indicator, concentional investor interest and corporate devs are likely mostly being thrown at permissioned and ip secured blockchains right now.

100% agree @artik123 thanks for articulating. From a pragmatic point of view, there are a few devs - yes.  UTXO based contracts - yes harder than a VM at this stage.  Accounts, yes, has not been focus by devs.  100s millions in marketing budget, no.

So, to use your ship analogy because I am a passionate sailor ❤️ ⛵️, the wind is blowing a bear market, and the goal is around the corner of the point in the distance, the current is against us, but it will change with the tide.  Current course is out to sea where few people can see us, but we have radio contact and good relationships with key people.  When we are headed on final tack with solutions to some key integration points (atomic swaps, btc security in dPoW, nspv light clients with existing CC support, FSM & better community mgmt) headed to the goal - we will have a welcoming party behind the point at our goal.

Timing.  Ppl are hard at work, stuff is still in alpha/beta.

@actionslacks Thanks 
"Kmd's only real problem is that it's not holding hundreds of millions of ico funds"
 - are you sure about that? 

I much prefer to win a poker table when I'm 
being dealt with 10 and a jack rather  than two aces. Usually when I'm being dealt with two aces I lose...

The other side of your argument is that if komodo succeeds your ROI will be much better.

Microsoft & Apple won the battle against a monstrous giant IBM !  (With practically an unlimited amount of cash) Starting as 2 guys from a garage...  who would have believed this could happen at that time?

My point is that you should play with the cards you have. And if you play them really well, you have a decent chance

It reminds me something.
In the early 90's Microsoft was an open system and Apple was a closed system. Probably the biggest reason why they lost.

[26-Dec-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i have trained several devs to make CC, not just to code them, but to be able to design them. the reason we dont have a lot more is simple: budget

[26-Dec-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if we can hire 100 devs, we can have 100 CC devs

[26-Dec-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but devs dont work for free and this is where the 100s of millions raised in ICO makes a difference, they can and do hire hundreds of devs

[26-Dec-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
with CC, it is harder to make than an ETH smart contract, but easier to do than a ETH smart contract to invoke an existing CC. and this using of the existing CC is far more what is the level of the less serious developer

[26-Dec-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
from command line arguments, you will be able to create a pegged and backed chain using any crypto and pegged to anything that has a price API

[26-Dec-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
think of it as writing bash scripts

[26-Dec-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
not anything hardcore, yet a lot has been created with bash scripts.

[26-Dec-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
as it is the handful of CC devs are making enough new tech to keep the marketing side saturated. if we had 100 CC devs... there would be way too much tech and the 1/tech effect will kill the price

[26-Dec-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
saying that KMD is a closed system because it is open source but not using the most trendy languages is silly

[26-Dec-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
you can write anything in one language that you can in another, i was just an simple C programmer, yet i seem to have been able to write a lot of relevant blockchain code.

[26-Dec-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a reason almost all the core cryptographic code is written in C

[26-Dec-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
having the CC being based on C (C++) is not any disadvantage in the difficulty to create full featured CC, and nothing stops bindings in other languages to be made.

[26-Dec-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we have experience of making language bindings in many different languages with supernet_api, hardly anybody used these other languages. but nothing stops anybody from doing the same for the CC

[26-Dec-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr to have inexperienced weekend coders be able to create a CC in a weekend is not realistic (nor anything that should be desired), but in a weekend you can do "shell scripts" that invoke existing CC and that is 10x to 100x the programmers that can do things at that level

more C code has been written than in most other languages. there are millions of C coders

[26-Dec-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody who wants to is able to read the bitcoin, zcash , komodo source code

[26-Dec-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing needs to be paid, nor registered or even an email signup. just go to github, it is all there and documented.

[26-Dec-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
there are plans for onboarding consulting companies who have experienced coders

[26-Dec-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this imaginary goal of getting coders who dont want to learn the bitcoin protocol, to be able to make CC, is wrong. there are many who understand bitcoin protocol and C/C++

[26-Dec-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
in a weekend, any experienced coder that knows the bitcoin protocol and C/C++ can write a CC. and only the utxo aspect of bitcoin protocol is needed. if they cant be bothered to learn this, they should not be writing consensus code

[26-Dec-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
why dont you suggest to linux that they rewrite the kernal so that coders who only fancy some of the new languages can write device drivers? that they shouldnt need to bother to learn what a device driver should do, but still be able to write one. unix is a total failure since you need to know C to be able to contribute to it

[26-Dec-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that some types of coding is difficult, like consensus code. only the best coders should be writing the most difficult code, otherwise you just end up with broken consensus.

[26-Dec-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
there are thousands of blockchain projects, but probably only hundreds who are experienced and capable of doing consensus code. CC actually makes it a LOT easier to write consensus code than just making mods to the bitcoin source. if you have not done both, you are not in a position to make credible statements about the difficulty level

[26-Dec-19 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
give me 100 senior C++ coders and in a few months there will be 100 CC coders, if that is not enough wait another 6 months after that for those 100 to train 1000 more. So the problem here is not the tech stack. I there can be 1000 CC coders within a year, clearly the lack of CC coders is not the problem

[26-Dec-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, paying for 1000 coders... that is the issue and making sdk for other languages wont solve the problem.

backup your wallet.dat
delete blocks/ , chainstate/ , notarisations/, komodostate, komodostate.ind from your data directory
then extract the bootstrap's contents to it

👌

[26-Dec-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
@richardt i dont think it makes sense to raise funds just for hiring and training CC devs. really, each project that needs a CC should hire their CC devs and i can help train them. also, what exactly can we sell to raise funds for hiring CC devs?

let me check my installation

[26-Dec-19 02:27 PM] gcharang#6833
your app version seems to be correct, but looks like you are on a fork
@Catalyst 
you can reindex or use a bootstrap
which option do you prefer?

[26-Dec-19 02:28 PM] richardt#2807
@jl777c Getting CC devs is just a part of all this isn't it? What about support, GUI, and marketing people, etc.? I assume they don't work for free either

[26-Dec-19 02:28 PM] Catalyst#8405
the one that is safe and me precious kmd are safe 😅

[26-Dec-19 02:29 PM] gcharang#6833
as long as you have regular backups of wallet.dat, your precious KMD are safe :D
using a bootstrap is a faster option

will reindexing take the same time too?

[26-Dec-19 02:33 PM] gcharang#6833
anyway, reindex might not resolve your issue
my suggestion is to either sync from scratch or use bootstrap

[26-Dec-19 02:33 PM] Catalyst#8405
hmmmmmm going for the reindex first

[26-Dec-19 02:33 PM] Catalyst#8405

[26-Dec-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
@richardt yes, of course and we dont lack depth in the tech stack so artik theory that KMD is a failure without allowing CC to be created by less experienced devs, it is flawed

[26-Dec-19 03:24 PM] LocoMB#8593
looking at the crypto industry it seems to me as if there are many talented devs, but because it is all so new everybody gets sort of tunnel vision and is blinded by their particular own shiny shiny Blinkenlichten (_this_ is the one that is better than BTC), oblivious to everything else out there- atomization of talent pool is what I am getting at.. some shinies get more attention than others, but once initiated into a particular guild, it is hard to even realize others, let alone switch to them- maybe good strategy would be to slowly build a cult following (as KMD is doing I think) ... just my 2cents

[26-Dec-19 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo has a habit of incorporating most of the interesting blinkenlichtens, from what i have seen the other multichain platforms are not being used to create new consensus mechanisms anyway (that seems to be the premise of KMD is failing to get adoption narrative)

[26-Dec-19 03:53 PM] munhenhos#3463
@gcharang thank you

[26-Dec-19 04:22 PM] richardt#2807
@jl777c If the tech is solid, more funding would only make it better. As to how to obtain more funding - probably only through angel/venture investors at this point

[26-Dec-19 04:23 PM] richardt#2807
However, KMD isn't a company

[26-Dec-19 04:26 PM] richardt#2807
Either that or wait till the next bull market and really capitalize on it

[26-Dec-19 04:28 PM] richardt#2807
As we've seen with previous bull and bear markets (2013 and 2017), many projects slowly die off, even those with promising tech.

[26-Dec-19 04:30 PM] richardt#2807
I think there's a decent chance if KMD is unable to fully take advantage of the next bull market, it could also slowly fade. As many of us have already seen, the competition only gets more fierce and in the end - the project with both tech and funding will come out on top

[26-Dec-19 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
in spite of everything, KMD still ranging between #50 and #60 indicates it will be one of the long term survivors. we do have enough funding to keep going for many more years and being in the surviving top 100 for the next bull cycle, will only increase our position. a lot of the top 100 are filled with projects that wont last

and are projects that arent really 'projects' as such, but more stablecoins etc

I guess after the next bull cycle, we will know where KMD really stands
