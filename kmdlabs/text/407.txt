It shows vote now, but I saw no txid to even track confirms of - or am I just hopelessly missing something somewhere?

[27-May-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
you just want it to print the txid of vote tx after you do it?

[27-May-19 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
or show vote txid in results?

[27-May-19 02:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
lol at when you make things too easy around here.... "its not like the CLI, its not telling me anything, what is happening" 😂

[27-May-19 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
the results thing is still using a workaround for the oraclessamples bug that was fixed

[27-May-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
once I removed the workaround, the results should show instantly without a conf

[27-May-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 you want txid for vote shown in results?

[27-May-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
or you want the vote txid to show after voting?

[27-May-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
some way to know that the vote is "in process" and the user is actively waiting on "something" in order to see they did it and that it's not some error that isn't showing
so, most likely the `or you want the vote txid to show after voting`

[27-May-19 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
like I said, once workaround is removed, the vote will show it results immediately

[27-May-19 02:34 PM] Nabob#5004
and also can we prevent registering twice to vote poll

[27-May-19 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
it doesn't matter

[27-May-19 02:35 PM] Nabob#5004
script still allows to register multiple times

[27-May-19 02:35 PM] Nabob#5004

```Success! You voted "yes"

seems I missed that bit the 1st time, so ignore all I said above 😛

op err is powerful

[27-May-19 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah I came to the conclusion trying to make things that account for all possible op errors is impossible....

[27-May-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
*spends 10mins writing his "subjective" response to receive error and lose it*

[27-May-19 02:49 PM] Alright#0419
what error?

[27-May-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
tx not confirmed

[27-May-19 02:49 PM] Alright#0419
ahh

[27-May-19 02:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
"you must register"

It's someone claiming to be Cris. Most likely is as it was able to produce a signed message from his NN key.
I will hop on a voice call with him though to be 100%
says he's locked out of @CrisF
oh that account is showing as online O.o
or was just a second ago
```
Just noticed this part `oh that account is showing as online O.o
or was just a second ago`
Please note, the `CrisF` account is down until, at least, further notice.

[27-May-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
registered 2 times, still isnt working 😦

[27-May-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
are they confirmed?

[27-May-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
could be a problem with subjective exception

[27-May-19 02:51 PM] Alright#0419
what the the exact error printed?

[27-May-19 02:51 PM] blackjok3r#3181
could be... ``Error: You must register to this poll before voting. The register txid must be confirmed as well.`

[27-May-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
there is only 1 poll.... so I registered for the right one

[27-May-19 02:52 PM] Alright#0419
yea let me add the real error

[27-May-19 02:52 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

[27-May-19 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
this is from your NN?

[27-May-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yes

[27-May-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
i git pulled

[27-May-19 02:54 PM] Alright#0419
it throws that error if `mypk`(-pubkey) is not found in oraclesinfo

[27-May-19 02:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmmm

[27-May-19 02:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe my daemon needs updating? weird

[27-May-19 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
I see your pubkey in oraclesinfo

[27-May-19 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
do you?

[27-May-19 02:58 PM] Alright#0419
do list polls and take txid from there and use oraclesinfo on it

[27-May-19 02:58 PM] blackjok3r#3181
just started update incase... that will take forever 😅

[27-May-19 03:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
voted subjective in the poll, just to see if it worked. After update it worked.... Hopefully vote passes without my yes.

[27-May-19 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
half way there already

[27-May-19 03:21 PM] Alright#0419
just want to say, that it's an NN's responsibility to determine if a bounty claim is fair. Don't just jump in with the rest of the crowd, go with your gut

[27-May-19 03:23 PM] blackjok3r#3181
IMO, the vote was based on something subjective.... Not sure it should like that... like, "I fixed this problem" is ok, or "I found this problem" 
But "to use as he pleases, isnt really correct" 
Again my oppinion, but Im just thinking for future, with a CC, it must be objective choice.

[27-May-19 03:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
That said, this is an ecellent thing for us to start with, so we should do it anyway 😄

[27-May-19 03:24 PM] Alright#0419
"to use as he pleases" objectively says it's subjective :troll:

[27-May-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_thinks that maybe a future requirement would be to make the proposer, and not the voters, do math_

[27-May-19 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
what math?

[27-May-19 03:46 PM] Alright#0419
counting who answered yes?

[27-May-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`1% from blocks 10080-10080*2`
requires math to know what you're dis/agreeing to

[27-May-19 04:18 PM] blubbi#0643
1008 LABS

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nope

[27-May-19 04:19 PM] blubbi#0643
?

[27-May-19 04:20 PM] blubbi#0643
100800 Labs a week * 1%

[27-May-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the reward isn't 1

[27-May-19 04:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
unless I misread the params

[27-May-19 04:22 PM] blubbi#0643
u missread the params !

[27-May-19 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I seem to be retarded, someone plz show me how/when it lowers to 1....

[27-May-19 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
10080 blocks per week * 10 coins per block = 100800
100800 * 0.01 = 1008

[27-May-19 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
am I missing something? 🤣

[27-May-19 04:27 PM] Alright#0419
10080-10080*2 is a way to show "week 2"

[27-May-19 04:27 PM] Alright#0419
`10080*2-10080*3` "week 3", etc

[27-May-19 04:27 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for some reason I saw his 1008 as 108 and that he said 'yes 1' when I said 'not 1' just feked my brain all up 😛

[27-May-19 04:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
There is 1% "extra coins" avalible for bounties... It can be used or it cant, for the first project we test, tony wants all of the bounty for a prize. Im cool with that, it wil be fun.

[27-May-19 04:33 PM] Alright#0419
just to clarify, it's not actually 10 coins per block. It's 8 coins per block and 1 coin every 5 blocks for notarizations

[27-May-19 04:34 PM] Alright#0419
and to clarify even further, it's *up to* 1 coin every 5 blocks

[27-May-19 04:35 PM] Alright#0419
that's the maximum, but it can be below that if notarizations aren't exactly every 5 blocks

[27-May-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`8 coins per block and 1 coin every 5 blocks`
Like I said,
math

[27-May-19 04:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
:troll:

[27-May-19 04:38 PM] blubbi#0643
but still 100.800 Labs a week ? 🤔

[27-May-19 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
the absolute maximum would be 101808/week, this assumes that a notarization happened every 5 blocks and the full bounty amount was claimed

[27-May-19 04:39 PM] Alright#0419
it will almost always be less than 100800 because notarizations don't happen every 5 blocks sometimes

[27-May-19 04:42 PM] blubbi#0643
now im confused

[27-May-19 04:43 PM] blubbi#0643
if its 10.080 blocks a 8 Labs and 2.016 blocks with notarization nd bounty

[27-May-19 04:43 PM] blubbi#0643
im far away from 100.800

[27-May-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
ok, assume a week is 10080 blocks(1 minute per block)
every single block 8 coins are made no matter what. This is the POW/POS distribution.

Now, notaries are paid via the ac_notarypay mechanism. Meaning every notarization they make, whichever notaries made that notarization, split 1 coin. The quickest notarizations will happen is 5 blocks.

I wrote in detail how it works here

[27-May-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
but notarizations can be slower than 5 blocks

every week, POS and POW will create 80640 coins 
every week, ac_notarypay can create *up to* 20160

[27-May-19 04:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
making that basically lost me a wife so 🤷

[27-May-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
that make sense @blubbi ?

[27-May-19 04:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
every reason my point was that instead of
`1% from blocks 10080-10080*2`
vote proposals should read
`approx. x coins total taken from blocks 10080-10080*2 in the form of y%`

[27-May-19 04:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
I hope thats a joke joker

[27-May-19 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
I think it's easiest to just say cap is 1008/week for bounties

[27-May-19 04:47 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`making that basically lost me a wife so :shrug:`

that only happened 2 days ago. It was difficult task for me

[27-May-19 04:52 PM] Alright#0419
I think it's much simpler to simply say the cap for bounties is 1008/week rather than literal 1% on top of emissions
