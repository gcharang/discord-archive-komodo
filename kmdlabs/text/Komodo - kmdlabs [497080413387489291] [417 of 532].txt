master repo being `github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker`?
because we don't even have the same init UI 🤷

yes, it's in the right folder, it created it (albeit months ago)

[02-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Oszy#5734
this is what i have

[02-Jun-19 01:29 PM] gcharang#6833
guys are you using the branch `restart`?

[02-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Oszy#5734
I am on master

[02-Jun-19 01:30 PM] gcharang#6833
restart branch should work. I have been using it without modifications

[02-Jun-19 01:34 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm on master, but restart has newer files.

[02-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Nabob#5004
using restart branch, i have python issues. again moved to master

[02-Jun-19 01:36 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'll have a look at both and see whats going on.
There was an older repo before `Staked` become `Labs`, so a few people still had the previous upstream earlier

[02-Jun-19 01:37 PM] gcharang#6833
virtual env should help with python versions and deps

[02-Jun-19 01:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
```git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/StakedChain/pos64staker (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/StakedChain/pos64staker (push)```
One of my older nodes, if you have this repo, backup your list.json files and clone `https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker`

@TonyL - managed to get prices working on a Bionic install (from source) - the dependencies are nasty.
What are the lines representing?

[02-Jun-19 01:51 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bar_F1sh_Rel great 👍  which lines?

[02-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
on the graphs - trace 0,1,2

[02-Jun-19 01:51 PM] TonyL#3577
```As you noticed there are 3 numbers for each sample:
mined (actual received) price
correlated price
smoothed price
```

[02-Jun-19 01:52 PM] TonyL#3577
in the same manner (0, 1, 2)

[02-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Nabob#5004

tony and I started the prices chain yesterday, going to work on adding it to the cluster today

[02-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
the actual prices CC will not work until it's "matured", but will just add it sometime today to get everything prepared

[02-Jun-19 05:31 PM] Alright#0419
if anyone wants another fungible chain, now is a good time to make the poll for it

[02-Jun-19 05:31 PM] gcharang#6833
thanks @Nabob will correct it

the fungible chain seems healthy, but I'm going to hold off until we have some other people around other than myself 
@blackjok3r @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @TonyL if you have some time to help me out with this today, please let me know

[02-Jun-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
no actual rush to get it onto the cluster as the prices CC thing has still not matured

is there anyone around that could help me with some nooby nginx stuff?

[02-Jun-19 09:58 PM] mrlynch#5735
what do u need? might doze off soon tho

[02-Jun-19 10:02 PM] Alright#0419
was having trouble getting it to stop properly

[02-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
just nuked it with kill -9 and seems to have worked

[02-Jun-19 10:03 PM] Alright#0419
Although now I'm facing another problem 😂

[02-Jun-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
`sudo service nginx stop`

[02-Jun-19 10:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
what's that?

[02-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
would just give me nothing when I was doing it

[02-Jun-19 10:06 PM] Alright#0419
kill -9'd it and started it again and `sudo systemctl restart nginx` is working again

[02-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
have this setup to where I can start up a new instance of prices dapp really easily, if anyone wants to try it, lmk

[02-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Alright#0419
will just give you a link and login creds and you can try prices dapp on CFEKBET1

[03-Jun-19 05:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Blocktime on CFEKBET1 is huge - thought I had lost my funds making a position!

[03-Jun-19 06:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, 5 minutes blocks

[03-Jun-19 11:44 AM] Oszy#5734
`Segmentation fault (core dumped)` Got this daemon stopped.

[03-Jun-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Dat feeling when restarted node, and waiting for staked blocks

[03-Jun-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
But forgot to `setgenerate true 0`

[03-Jun-19 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
@Oszy `Segmentation fault (core dumped) Got this daemon stopped.` from which repo/branch is your daemon?

[03-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Oszy#5734
KMDLabs/komodo

[03-Jun-19 11:55 AM] Oszy#5734
It was fine all along, first time i saw this

[03-Jun-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Dat feeling when `tail -f debug.log | grep 'generated'` for 18 hrs is more than a full screen...

now to look through the actual log and see how many were orphaned 😦

[03-Jun-19 12:07 PM] jorian#4555
not so many i guess?

[03-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Nabob#5004
`Could not load list.json please make sure it is in the directory where komodod is located. Exiting` 
Getting this error on labs stdout, I kept file in komodod location. chains looks good

[03-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Nabob#5004
Seems staker.py,  needs to be updated with absolute location

[03-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Oszy#5734
I put a copy of it into pos64staker folder as well, I think TUI wouldn't work

[03-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Nabob#5004
found, daemon needs to started from  pos64staker folder 👶

[03-Jun-19 12:38 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
@Oszy what are your server specs?

[03-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Oszy#5734
it's a VM 4 core 8gb ram

[03-Jun-19 12:40 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that shoud be enough. Which coins' daemon is crashing?

[03-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Oszy#5734
This was during staking LABS, using the KMDLabs/komodo repo

[03-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Oszy#5734
Only happened once in 4 days

[03-Jun-19 12:41 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I had a similar issue with CFEKBET1 earlier, because I was running it manually and using wrong komodod

[03-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Oszy#5734
I'll keep running it see if it comes up again.

[03-Jun-19 12:42 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if you launch with ./start.sh it should be fine. I also rebuilt the daemon just in case

[03-Jun-19 12:56 PM] CrisF#3405
I also had a `Segmentation fault` yesterday.  Restarted and it hasn't had trouble since.

[03-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i had a crash at the very beginning, but it runs stable for a long time now

[03-Jun-19 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
Rough notary stats since about this time yesterday

[03-Jun-19 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
for the lower half of the nodes anyways

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`x - y`
x and y = what?

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
X is current stats.py output

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
y is the diff from yesterdays output

[03-Jun-19 01:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
total notarizations in ~24 hours = y

`5mins+ long block` = too many miners and not enough stakers
