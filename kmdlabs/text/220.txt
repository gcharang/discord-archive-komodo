this thing is like that but worse... Its fine for simple things, but as I started adding things to it... it seemed a bit silly to have so many functions all containg the exact same code over and over.

[13-Jan-19 06:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah better to keep everything as simple as possible imo - abstract from everything besides of komodo software usage logic

[13-Jan-19 06:27 AM] TonyL#3577
So it'll make an entry level lower

Going to add segid to listunspent... will make withdrawing much easier.

This rpc_connection object logic attracted me because I wrote 2 lines of code - and was able to communicate with daemon as I want and get a predictable same format data

[13-Jan-19 06:29 AM] TonyL#3577
No need to decode or encode something or anything else, lib cares about it for me 😃

```put utxos into object sorted by segid .. like this:
    listunspent, sort by confirms.
    iterate down listunspent 
    put each utxo into list of segids utxos['segid'].append(utxo)
    should return object with each segid's utxos sorted by confirms.```

Will migrate staker repo to this RPC method first though...

staker.py is migrated and fully error checked with proper exceptions.  Doing sendmany scripts next.

Done. Fond a few bugs with scripts along the way and fixed those too.

Note, dont run sendmany script on node with -pubkey set mining to another wallet 😂

[13-Jan-19 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Had great idea for withdraw script too... simply lock all utxos you want to keep, use sendtoaddress / sendmany.. then unlock them again. 😃

[13-Jan-19 10:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Can advice to use rpc_connection as function argument - it will allow to re-use function with different connections with different names in different places of code or even different files

[13-Jan-19 10:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make the def_credentials inside a seperate file... but it dodnt work... If youc an get it to work that would be very nice.

[13-Jan-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
copy the whole thing into the to pof every file si stupid... but I didnt want to waste time on it

[13-Jan-19 10:18 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/StakedChain/pos64staker/blob/master/genaddresses.py#L51 let's say this function now will work only if you'll call variable name "rpc_connection"

It's just kinda `def genvaldump(rpc_connection):`
And then call it as genvaldump(someconnectionobjecthere)

[13-Jan-19 10:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Can make PR if needed sure

[13-Jan-19 10:19 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thats fine.. all those scripts now work. What I want ideally is a file we can just import like
`import rpc_connection`
and then we can just do
` cfek_connection = def_credentials('CFEK') `

[13-Jan-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I wasnt able to get that to work

[13-Jan-19 10:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but when I copy pasted the def_credantials function and all its deps into the file it did work 🤷

[13-Jan-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
What do you want to do by `import rpc_connection`?

[13-Jan-19 10:21 AM] blackjok3r#3181
make it so that we dont need the entire def_credantials function in every singl file... if one change is made to it we need to edit every script

[13-Jan-19 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
rpc_connection it's an object - not module
to import `def_credinails` function you have to write: `from pythonfile import def_credentials`

[13-Jan-19 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
And all reusable stuff can separate to one file and use it as internal project lib (this pythonfile)

[13-Jan-19 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh cool. thanks. I will change that later... I was getting close to a listunspent filter ... thenm my computer froze. Give up for today. Come back to it tomorrow

I've satisfied on this output - but don't know full logic

[13-Jan-19 11:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
That's right... Sendmany64 is very simple... The random version took quite a while. And u won't be able to test the staker without coins, until I manage to work out the listunspent filter I don't want to send any coins as it could stall the chain.

[13-Jan-19 11:37 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@TonyL - just following through the logic in the v2 migrate script.
Is a third txt file required for the KMD signed dest-chain imports? - not sure if you can sign the same migration twice on KMD if the import to destination fails??

[13-Jan-19 11:43 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bar_F1sh_Rel Oh yeah I think it's needed to save `dest_tx_list` and `complete_tx_list` to re-execute this one https://github.com/StakedChain/PoS_scripts/blob/master/CC_scripts/migrations_python/migration_script_v2.py#L80
I just saved proposed by @Alright  parts - didn't look deep into it since never faced timeout on this part

It used to fail.on import but now it doesn't

[13-Jan-19 11:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The o ly way it fails is if the script or node crashes out

[13-Jan-19 11:53 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - also writelines doesn't add any seperators - so it's all one long string

Just need export tx hex and payouts

And u can resume the processes

[13-Jan-19 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bar_F1sh_Rel Oh yes, it's better to separate lines 😃 
But can slice each 64 symbols on reading so file is compressed (without /n bytes haha) :trollface:

It would be great if you can make a PR for outputs storage improvement

[13-Jan-19 01:35 PM] TonyL#3577
@blackjok3r btw maybe problem which you've faced when tried to re-use your code is  that you tried to import functions from file which you execute. Python renaming first executed module to `__main__` so you can't proper import from this module

[13-Jan-19 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
from reading the script... your waiting for each stage to complete for all steps and txns?

[13-Jan-19 02:07 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
I suppose you could launch the script every 2 minutes to catch alternate blocks

[13-Jan-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... if you do like 1000 at a time. the bash version is limited as, because its 1 script for each migrate... py version can do way more

[13-Jan-19 02:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its possible to nearly fill blocks wityh 3-4 nodes

[13-Jan-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it's possible to run few instances of python script in background

[13-Jan-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
To try fill blocks from the same instance

If one single one has to wait for the next notarisation it will slow it down by about 5 mins

[13-Jan-19 02:17 PM] blackjok3r#3181
trick will be to make sure they all happen at once.

[13-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
or be able to branch

[13-Jan-19 02:18 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
as current block fill will not be known

[13-Jan-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
It's possible to speedup script a lot I think if use intermediate data storage in process and broadcast each step separate permanently as a queues

[13-Jan-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
you could check on the export tx stage fopr confirm,. they were all in the same block

[13-Jan-19 02:18 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then thread it

[13-Jan-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh just append successful things to the bottom of list and permanently check from next step this list

[13-Jan-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
And next step pop top item from this list

[13-Jan-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the limit is how much you can poll the daemon... at some point it just stoips responding

[13-Jan-19 02:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one thing you can know... is what ever export tx was in a block will reach the same stage at the exact same time

[13-Jan-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
You can set a delay between RPC calls like a 0.01 second if on some point daemon is hangs

[13-Jan-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
But I've never got state of hanged daemon with this RPC lib even when did very scary While True things

[13-Jan-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah.. its mostly a limit on bash

[13-Jan-19 02:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
py is much nicer way to do it

[13-Jan-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
You have a tons of language packages for everything you want to do and if it's not enough you have tons of open sourced community packages

[13-Jan-19 02:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@Deleted User  was right... should have started using it a long time ago 😉

[13-Jan-19 02:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
still for me... the C++/C stuff is better.... it goes way faster.. If I can offload some heavy load to daemon its like 100x faster

[13-Jan-19 02:26 PM] blackjok3r#3181
listunspent call to add segid.. if use py to fetch each tx address then get segid... would take minutes or longer... from daemon no diffrence in time.

[13-Jan-19 02:28 PM] TonyL#3577
C and Python were designed for different things. C as I know mostly compilers/OSes/protocol stuff writing things. Even Python written on C hehe.
