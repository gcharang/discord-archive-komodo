or is that too expressive 😄

[14-Dec-18 09:46 AM] CrisF#3405
And at some point we will need an `UP`.  We haven't had an 'official' `CFEKUP` yet.

[14-Dec-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lets make this one CFEKUP 😂

[14-Dec-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my period is FEKEDUP

[14-Dec-18 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181

How can you ignore @blackjok3r's presence like that? 😮

`pip3 install requests python-bitcoinlib hashlib base58`
from that line

[14-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
no idea what that is 😓

[14-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
is it just hashlib failing?

[14-Dec-18 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
maybe unsupported on that version of python

[14-Dec-18 10:57 AM] Alright#0419
Oh the module is installed by default

[14-Dec-18 10:58 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't need to be in dependencies

[14-Dec-18 10:58 AM] Alright#0419
updated readme

[14-Dec-18 03:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
I'm even further back, stuck on ImportErrors, probably a feked Python3 from downgrading to Stretch

[14-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice can you show me error message?

[14-Dec-18 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
that is definitely not ready btw, need to touch up the readme or staker script

[14-Dec-18 03:02 PM] Alright#0419
if you want to try it anyway, make sure you edit CHAIN variable in staker.py

get rid of `hashlib`

[14-Dec-18 03:02 PM] CMaurice#1685
kk, trying

[14-Dec-18 03:03 PM] CMaurice#1685
nope, my issues are more basic, related to dependencies to even getting the libs installed I think

@LabsAssistant 
Sapling is active on most of our chains. To notarise them we need to update. There is a fix for the coins files pushed to master along with a whole bunch of other important fixes from yesterday. Until everyone updates things wil not go smoothly. but we are on testnet. Once everyone is readyand things are working normally again, we need to do one last MoMoM migrate stress test.

[15-Dec-18 01:31 AM] SHossain#0007
@blackjok3r we have to update?

[15-Dec-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just testing it now...

[15-Dec-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes... no need for any coins files here, our deamon generates them on start

[15-Dec-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
./stop.sh
./start.sh

[15-Dec-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
is all we need to do.

[15-Dec-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that said, mine is refusing to build so wait a minute toill I fix it

[15-Dec-18 01:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Had build fail on 3 Staked nodes about an hour ago.

[15-Dec-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes I pushed an update earier that was missing a ;

[15-Dec-18 01:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just fixed

[15-Dec-18 01:35 AM] CrisF#3405
ty

[15-Dec-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
my mistake

[15-Dec-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still broken

[15-Dec-18 01:36 AM] blackjok3r#3181
sorry guys ... merge conglicts

[15-Dec-18 01:37 AM] CrisF#3405
np 👍

[15-Dec-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is restarting now ...

[15-Dec-18 01:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be ok. it builds at least.

[15-Dec-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
LAME ducks no connections again ... invstigating

[15-Dec-18 02:01 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm I think we nede to kill DUCKS ...

[15-Dec-18 02:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not reversing up stream changes to magic vlaues to save it ... as it will just screw us over later.

[15-Dec-18 02:02 AM] gt#2812
ducks no connection on mine too

[15-Dec-18 02:04 AM] CrisF#3405
Mine had it's last notarization on any chain ~90 mins ago.

[15-Dec-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I removed it from assetchains.json

[15-Dec-18 02:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
stop and start again

👍 

[15-Dec-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  KMD notaries all broke too 😂

[15-Dec-18 02:05 AM] CrisF#3405
Doh...

[15-Dec-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as we have less nodes... we might beat them to getting back online

[15-Dec-18 02:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Let's do it :abusedsmily:

[15-Dec-18 02:06 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To force it to work faster we can change iguana port ... but I really cant be botehred for a testnet

[15-Dec-18 02:07 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mine is restarted ... will attempt to restart all mining nodes and stakers soon with new mempool fix, it might stop them getting broken. I found a fair few issues last night with CC chain miners.

[15-Dec-18 02:08 AM] CrisF#3405
I haven't been able to get miners online since last week 😅

[15-Dec-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yeah... I broke it trying to fix it

[15-Dec-18 02:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the mempool gets over a certain size of txs they just dead lock

[15-Dec-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
why all the chains kept stalling

[15-Dec-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I fixed it last night and pushed it to FSM, merged it back down just before.

[15-Dec-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Likely a few other things I need to revert aswell, but will leave them for now.

[15-Dec-18 02:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just gald its fixed, or well I hope it is.

[15-Dec-18 02:12 AM] CrisF#3405
I deleted komodo &  StakedModo. Had 4 fails on ./buildkomodo.sh.

[15-Dec-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you have enough disk space this time

[15-Dec-18 02:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
?

[15-Dec-18 02:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Probably not.

[15-Dec-18 02:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok... well Im going to update my stakers now will see how it goes.

[15-Dec-18 02:15 AM] CrisF#3405
thx

[15-Dec-18 02:18 AM] metaphilibert#0926
updating
taking more time than forseen because rm rf komodo in root instead of in StakedNotary 😅

[15-Dec-18 02:19 AM] gt#2812
updated

[15-Dec-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#3181
shouldnt need to remove komodo in StakedNotary (?)

[15-Dec-18 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
All my stakers are now moving again, had 2 locked up chains

[15-Dec-18 02:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CFEKED and CFEK

[15-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
those were the ones that were stalled.

[15-Dec-18 02:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_is frozen at `[KMD] Stopping ...`_

[15-Dec-18 02:28 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
_after_ `./start.sh`

[15-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if thats the case remove komodo.pid from `~/.komodo`

[15-Dec-18 02:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is if komodod stopped

[15-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that relase we were all on, was a bit buggy ... maybe it cant stop

[15-Dec-18 02:29 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r What kind of disk space is being used?

[15-Dec-18 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
```genie@StakedNotary:~/StakedNotary$ rm ~/.komodo/komodo.pid
rm: cannot remove '/home/genie/.komodo/komodo.pid': No such file or directory```

[15-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
did you stop it first ?

[15-Dec-18 02:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this update requires you to stop everything

[15-Dec-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iguana is the main thing that needs updating, but as we pull all configs for it from the daemon, the daemon needs to update first.

[15-Dec-18 02:30 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, stopped, rebooted, and that was the result of start.sh

[15-Dec-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm strange

[15-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the .pid file isnt there, it should proceed

[15-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it used to poll pgrep ... but that was super unreliable ... maybe it needs that as a fallback if the file isnt removed after 120 tries or something 🤔

[15-Dec-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
still that doesnt make any sense in your case

[15-Dec-18 02:33 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
or because it's linux and spelling counts

[15-Dec-18 02:34 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
komodod.pid != komodo.pid, ya dink 😛

[15-Dec-18 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
lol

[15-Dec-18 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am tryng to do 100 things at once ... I typed it from memory

[15-Dec-18 02:35 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`... I typed it from memory`
Stop that, you don't have one of those

[15-Dec-18 02:35 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@CrisF  48GB on this node in total, out of 100GB (but its ful of all kinds of crap)

[15-Dec-18 02:58 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do we not have 5 NNs updated in order *to* notarize?
