The MoMoM data base does not disregard notarisations out of order...

[29-Jan-19 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
iut adds them all... then scans a range of them looking for a valid hash

[29-Jan-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the block is rejected, so is the notarization

[29-Jan-19 06:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes... so it makes it again you think?

[29-Jan-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and it will be skipped

[29-Jan-19 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the notariser assumes that the notariasation will just be valid and accepted as a transactino

[29-Jan-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so if N+1 comes in before N, then N+1 is accepted, N rejected

[29-Jan-19 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then a MoMoM hash will be missing

[29-Jan-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then the miner will notice block rejected and make a new block

[29-Jan-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
MoMoM has to handle skipped notarizations

[29-Jan-19 06:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm... the whole problem with it was that is didnt

[29-Jan-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
if the block is rejected all tx inside are rejected

[29-Jan-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It had to brute force scan a heap of them to find the corect one

[29-Jan-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only way is to test it I guess

[29-Jan-19 06:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its not ahrd to take the heigh restriction away if ti causes problems

[29-Jan-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization tx shouldnt ever get validated, but you need to enforce that and make sure it doesnt come in at a different position in block

[29-Jan-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
this does give the notaries power to invalidate a block

[29-Jan-19 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think its more the miner than notary....

[29-Jan-19 06:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if miner doesnt include the notarisation... but thats already an issue

[29-Jan-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
miners can always make invalid blocks

[29-Jan-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but if notaries make out of order notarization, the miner mines it and it is invalid block

[29-Jan-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it goes into mempool, then the miner mines it again...

[29-Jan-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so you need to prevent adding it back into the mempool

[29-Jan-19 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this is what Im saying... it would be simpler to just let it be out of order

[29-Jan-19 06:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a very very rare case that it happens

[29-Jan-19 06:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like 0.5%

[29-Jan-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so no need for height check. that wont break any other assumptions?

[29-Jan-19 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I dont think so... but this ie earlyt stages... Alright came up with the idea and I figured it would be possible.

[29-Jan-19 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Trying to work out how I can add all the code witout actually creating and validating the coins fisrt to see if it can actually work.

[29-Jan-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
otherwise testing it will be hell... ppl needing to update everty few hours 😂

[29-Jan-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
just use a CC

[29-Jan-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
lock all the block 1 coins in the CC

[29-Jan-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or a special chain that allows any coinbase

[29-Jan-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and the CC allows spending based on whatever rules

[29-Jan-19 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Can we use that to add more couins to the contract to keep the chain going?

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like fauct fund

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
to the notarisation contract

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
create coins out of thin air, requires making a -ac_selfimport type of mechanism

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
no not out opf thin air

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but you can always just add more funds to CC

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just anyone can buy and send coins to the CC address tro "refil it"

[29-Jan-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
dont use sendtoaddress!

[29-Jan-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but using the custom rpc call to send to CC, yes anyone can refill it

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Jan-19 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cool this was something I suggested... if it is not too hard it is the way to go as it colves more problems in one go

[29-Jan-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i recommend making a cclib.cpp custom CC for this custom spending rules for notary pay

[29-Jan-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
CC allows it to be refilled... But its not needed... eg:
tx[1] in block is notarisation verify this as best as possible (check pubkeys of vins? and to RXL address)
tx[0] in this block pays each pubkey X coins from either "thin air" as a comission calcualtion
OR 
tx[0] pays same but from a CC address. 
if notarisation is invalid then block is rejected at very last step.

[29-Jan-19 07:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I 'm leaning more towards CC ... but dont want this taking anouth year 😅

[29-Jan-19 07:05 AM] blackjok3r#3181
controling exact coin emission by printing coins is much harder.... as notarisations dont happen like clockwork

[29-Jan-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what I am saying is that the CC will allow to not have to payout in lockstep in the block

[29-Jan-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
basically each valid notarization would earn coins from the CC

[29-Jan-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and they can be spent as soon as the notarization happens

[29-Jan-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a 0.0001 marker utxo can be made each block, which wont affect coin supply much and each one triggers an eligible amount calculation that can be spent by a notary

[29-Jan-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the rules are pretty much set, you can just payout in coinbase and valiate that

[29-Jan-19 07:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Thew only thing im concerned about with the ac-end is that we dont know exactly how many notarisations will happen in X blocks.

[29-Jan-19 07:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it can only be an average... like expect every 5... so some supply will be burnt as it is not evey 5, but is most of the time.

VALIDATED.
NOTARY CHECK PAY VALID?
```

[29-Jan-19 11:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Its a bit crude but its working... Probably full of bugs, but maybe only few hours away from making a test chain. I think I will let validation have any amount for coinbase, just so we dont ahve to constantl;y hard fork it.

[29-Jan-19 12:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Definatly cannot handle era changes... but thats not really an issue for now.

[29-Jan-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Not using CC yet.... As I dont know how to do that... But it should be abel to be dropped in to the same places int he code later on.

[29-Jan-19 12:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Iderally a CC would be best... each notarisation "unlocks" X balance for a notary and they can jsut withdraw whenever they like.

[29-Jan-19 12:41 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Saves consolidating utxos and stuff aswell. And you can top it up to keep the chain going longer.

[29-Jan-19 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
@blackjok3r being able to produce an invalid notarization that is accepted to miner's mempool is a problem

[29-Jan-19 01:43 PM] Alright#0419
can prevent them from mining

[29-Jan-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Im not sure how to actually do that

[29-Jan-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
It checks the min sigs, and needs to be signed by official notaries

[29-Jan-19 01:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
The only way this can happen right now, is if the notariser starts making invlaid notarisations

[29-Jan-19 01:45 PM] Alright#0419
ah, so it is checking the signers?

[29-Jan-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes

[29-Jan-19 01:45 PM] Alright#0419
k no worries

[29-Jan-19 01:45 PM] blackjok3r#3181
1) Checks if tx is to RXL address
2) Extracts prev vout for each vin
3) checks is current elegible notary

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
4) builds block

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
5) submits

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
6) on connect block it checks the notarisation is valid (points the the corrrect block hash)

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] Alright#0419
I can explain how we would do this in CC btw

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If 6 fails we have problems

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] Alright#0419
you say it's because you don't know how to do it

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] Alright#0419
but you are more than capable

[29-Jan-19 01:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Just trying to get sometheing working... we can go fromt here

[29-Jan-19 01:47 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ONce the code is all in the code (lol) then its easy enough to just change parms... If we make the validation always pass for the test chain, we can test lots of stuff for building blocks wihtout coinstantly hard forking

[29-Jan-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
the main chain can stay like this if we build it

{Reactions}
💯 

[29-Jan-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Main issue si a chin with notarisations... cant ahve notaries updating evey few hours

[29-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
don't need a CC because the notarization payments are from emissions itself

[29-Jan-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Testong on CFEK just makign invalid blocks atm

[29-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
the fungible chains would definitely benefit from a CC though

[29-Jan-19 01:48 PM] blackjok3r#3181
yep

[29-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
what do you mean updating every few hours

[29-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if we make the test chain with full validation...

[29-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Alright#0419
we can just do a CFEK chain with less signers

[29-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
my idea is to make a test chain on a diff branch that just skips 99% of validation

[29-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
so like evey block is valid

[29-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Alright#0419
🚀

[29-Jan-19 01:49 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then notarys can jsut notarise away nd we can test validation on our own nodes

[29-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
ok let me know if you need anything

[29-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
