@gcharang

[26-May-19 05:58 AM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r that worked, thanks!
can you tell me what the problem was here?

[26-May-19 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
your mining rewards cannot be split. Notarisations pay you in the coinbase, which needs to be merged forwards . I am using the dwy_mitigation script in the repo every few hours. That seems to keep it working well.

[26-May-19 06:06 AM] gcharang#6833
that makes sense

[26-May-19 06:27 AM] gcharang#6833
@blackjok3r 
do you think the key
```
"notarized": <Bock height that has been notarized>
```
from the getinfo call be brought over to the response of `komodo-cli getrawtransaction <txid> 1` ?
I am modifying the insight explorer to take notarizations into account
but with the available info from getrawtransaction rpc, non dPoWd chains will have misleading behaviour as for them conf = rawconfs always
so if the `notarized` height is available from the txn rpc then there could be differentiation

[26-May-19 06:28 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You just want last notarized height in getrawtransaction 2 ?

[26-May-19 06:28 AM] gcharang#6833
yes
for non dpowed chains it will always be 0
for dpowd chains it will be the notarized height

[26-May-19 06:29 AM] gcharang#6833
getrawtransaction <txid> 1

[26-May-19 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can add that pretty easily yes. Give me 15mins, are you sure its 1? When I did the MoMoM corss chain for explorers I was sure it was using geraw2 ?

[26-May-19 06:30 AM] gcharang#6833
there is no difference b/w 1 and 2 I just checked

[26-May-19 06:30 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

@blackjok3r as Mylo gave me his spot, should I put my pubkey somewhere ?

[26-May-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
he needs to give you the key

[26-May-19 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
we cannot change pubkeys in the source easily

awesome news, thanks for it

reminder to self for nth time, not to be confused with OS updates or python envs or anything else, if `Starting KMD Failed: help human!` and it looks like it somewhere in validateaddress ITS ACTUALLY JUST THE DAEMONS ARE STILL RUNNING AND HAVEN'T BEEN STOPPED PROPERLY

[26-May-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
What? 😅

[26-May-19 08:55 AM] CMaurice#1685
it's something that happens to me regularly

[26-May-19 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
Going to slowly transition it all to python, so we can have better debug messages

_found out the hard way how devastating a bad python upgrade can be to debian_

[26-May-19 08:55 AM] CMaurice#1685
So I upgraded my OS to 18.04 and I'm getting  for iguana in ./start.sh: `iguana/iguana: error while loading shared libraries: libsodium.so.18`

[26-May-19 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
there are a few catch alls like that because of bash limitations

[26-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
if it were python, that would be showing you why it's failing

[26-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
that's what I mean @CMaurice

[26-May-19 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
because it's bash calling a python script, it doesn't show where exactly it's failing and in what script

[26-May-19 09:01 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`libsodium.so.18: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`
@CMaurice did you install libsodium?

[26-May-19 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
libsodium-dev

[26-May-19 09:03 AM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, but there may be some issue: libsodium-dev is already the newest version (1.0.16-2).

[26-May-19 09:05 AM] Alright#0419

[26-May-19 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
almost certainly will be

anything?

probably ln -s?

[26-May-19 09:10 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
rebuild iguana

[26-May-19 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
`sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsodium.so.23.1.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsodium.so.18` might work

[26-May-19 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
or 
`sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsodium.so.23 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsodium.so.18`

[26-May-19 09:11 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what the difference is there

[26-May-19 09:12 AM] CMaurice#1685
it seems to be the solution for other similar lib problems people have been having

[26-May-19 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
we're probably looking at the same git issue for random project I found on google 😛

[26-May-19 09:13 AM] CMaurice#1685
ok, so it's going to be this for many libs
now `iguana/iguana: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4: version `CURL_OPENSSL_3' not found (required by iguana/iguana)

`

[26-May-19 09:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
using a simlink to fake it or rebuilding the executable are the only options that I know of (because the executable is linked to a file from old OS that doesn't exist in the new one)

[26-May-19 09:13 AM] CMaurice#1685
thought I rebuilt everything though

[26-May-19 09:14 AM] CMaurice#1685
but maybe I'll have to do from scratch

[26-May-19 09:14 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
do a 
```make clean
git clean -f```
first

[26-May-19 09:15 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if you just do `make`, it still has "known" files to link to cached

[26-May-19 09:15 AM] CMaurice#1685
thanks. right. I did make clean

[26-May-19 09:16 AM] CMaurice#1685

@Alright - I can't remember the rpc/script to print the notary position list.

`./stats.py`

[26-May-19 09:33 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
ahhh - I forgot there's a stats and stats.py

[26-May-19 09:34 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Lol - maybe I should have changed my pubkey to reduce wallet size.

[26-May-19 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
just cleanwallettransactions and size doesn't matter

[26-May-19 09:45 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
yes - not so much - but the cleanwallettransactions takes ages on a large wallet.

[26-May-19 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
only the 1st time

[26-May-19 09:47 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
---------------------------
```if 'notaryname' in getinfo_result:
    notaryname = getinfo_result['notaryname']```
stats.py breaks when that if isn't true

[26-May-19 09:48 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Is that the IF that colorizes your notary (when your term supports it)

[26-May-19 09:49 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
looks like it

[26-May-19 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
