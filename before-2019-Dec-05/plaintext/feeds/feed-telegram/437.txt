[telegram] <Caleb> I’ve been buying kmd on hitbtc ... does that mean that they may not be valid coins? (re @polycryptoblog: we don’t want exchanges being on a fork if they somehow don’t update when they should so they were asked to put into maintenance mode until it is fully implemented)

[12-Nov-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> Tomo dex is see is a Token Platform
AtomicDex there is no token, only real coins 
And if I see it right Tomo Dex is only Eth/erc20 based. (re @aislanmonteiro: Hey guys, what is the difference between atomicdex and tomo dex?)

the coins you buy on an exchange are IOUs the exchange has given to your account
until you withdraw them to your own wallet, they are still IOUs
if you trust the exchange to be legit, they should honour your withdraw request after the maintenance @caleb

[12-Nov-19 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Forwarded from Regnar: Considering my post is from a while back, it just goes to show you how common this scam is. People say they want to trade? No problem. Use AtomicDEX or exchange. People give the "banned in my country" excuse they are getting banned.

[12-Nov-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Forwarded from Regnar: Remember everyone, if someone offers you a deal here through escrow, it's a scam. Admin here will NOT escrow trades, so if they say they are getting me, or any other admin here to escrow the trade, it is a lie. They likely made another account and named it and use the same profile icon like one of the admins to trick you.
Do NOT trade with people here. They will say "Crypto is illegal in my country" etc, Do NOT trade with them. They are lying to you to steal your money.
