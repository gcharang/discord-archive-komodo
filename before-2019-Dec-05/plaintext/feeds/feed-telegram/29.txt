[telegram] <BearTheTrader> i downloaded last release of hyperdex on osx now how i install it?

[23-Jun-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <DingDongSoLong> Isn’t version 2.4 about the be the new update cause I still got 2.38 & don’t want to update it to 2.39 if 2.4 is about to be the new version (re @Acura360: ??)

[telegram] <Hermes08> 2.40 is still on testing

[23-Jun-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Hermes08> It’s using the same procedure just open it with the right click and it should run (re @BearTheTrader: i downloaded last release of hyperdex on osx now how i install it?)

[23-Jun-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> ehm i think i downloaded another software that has exactly the same name

[23-Jun-18 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> yep definitely it is another app with the same name, found it with google and it is on github too

[23-Jun-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> For me 2.40 is working fine (re @DingDongSoLong: Isn’t version 2.4 about the be the new update cause I still got 2.38 & don’t want to update it to 2.39 if 2.4 is about to be the new version)

[23-Jun-18 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> i am trying to sell beer for pizza on hyperdex, i clicked on the beer buy orders and created the order now after 5 minutes of “pending” it became “unmatched” this is what i don’t understand if i accepted the price of the order in existence why it is not executed?

[23-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <BearTheTrader> this for me is a great doubt and makes me doubtful about the usability, everybody is used to centralised exchanges and usually when you trade and accept the price you get the tokens fast what is the problem with this system?

[23-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> are you in the komodo disqord ? (re @BearTheTrader: i am trying to sell beer for pizza on hyperdex, i clicked on the beer buy orders and created the order now after 5 minutes of “pending” it became “unmatched” this is what i don’t understand if i accepted the price of the order in existence why it is not executed?)

[telegram] <Intelligent Crypto Investor> This is why PRLPAY coins is very promising. They're having a private salenow and they're issuing a 3 year money back guarantee pegged at USD 0.20/PRLPAY coin. If someone will compute it they're selling it below USD 0.20 Because they have set a special prices on the exchange rate of their acceptable cryptocurrencies (i.e. 1BTC=$8,000 ; 1KMD=$2.60  ; 1BTC=40K PRLPAY ; 1KMD=13 PRLPAY) (re @Regnar: eality, but the Komodo team is actively building viable actual projects, and the marketing team is in fact ramping up behind the scenes. The community front (i'm not a team member, just active community member) we still need more help in, and would love more members to step up and do things like talk about Komodo on Social media, share and like pro KMD posts. tag their favorite influencers etc. 
Hope this provides some more insight for you.)

FA is more important than TA in the long run.

Check what the companies you are invested are doing during this bear trend.

Suddenly the news, developement and communications have slowed down?

Take notes. Probably the project is not worhty.
