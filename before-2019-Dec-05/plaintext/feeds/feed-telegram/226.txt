You would like to contribute to Trezor firmware? Great!
If you are working on a new feature, you probably want to contribute it to the trezor-core repository, not trezor-mcu. This currently runs on Trezor T only, but will soon be ported to Trezor One as well.

[telegram] <TonyStarkBR> After the most recent Coinomi "fuck up" (to use Luke's words), and learning who was Luke Childs, I went to research their past "fuck up" (that Electrum servers connection without SSL) and I can only say THANK YOU to Luke (is he here?)
I don't agree with Coinomi team picturing him as FUD mongering and they were extremely reactive and unprofessional!
I'm seriously thinking on not using their wallet anymore, can't trust them after all this! 😕 (re @Regnar: EVERYONE!! please be careful if you have input a seed phrase into Coinomi windows wallet (not sure of which other versions have this security flaw too) but apparently Coinomi seed input sends your seed phrase, in clear text(not encrypted), to Google's servers to spell check. I haven't verified the issue but a Komodo Dev, Luke Childs, has and shared on his Twitter so I'm passing it along here.
https://twitter.com/lukechilds/status/1100613365850767360?s=20
And here's the reported incident.
avoid-coinomi.com
"I would also strongly suggest anyone using Coinomi move your funds immediately to a different wallet. Your plain text seed phrase is quite likely sitting in a log file on Googles servers accessible to a large number of employees." - Luke Childs)

SECURITY VULNERABILITY

@CoinomiWallet sends your plain text seed phrase to Googles remote spellchecker API when you enter it! This is not a joke!

Video attached for proof.

[telegram] <CryptoBlockchain38> The more Blocks the better? (re @Regnar: No problem!)

[28-Feb-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Regnar> Kinda irrelevant imo. Different blockchains mine blocks at different speeds, bitcoin roughly 10 minutes, Komodo roughly 1 minute. Others are different too. It does have an effect on how big the blockchain gets itself which causes problems for Ethereum, but Komodo uses multi chains so you dont need to sync all the chains. Plus it's expected that storage capacity will keep pace or grow faster than a blockchains size (re @CryptoBlockchain38: The more Blocks the better?)
