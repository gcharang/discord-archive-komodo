[telegram] <Acura360> Yeah, i got same problem with 2.39
I‘m using 2.38 (re @Marcauj: Latest agama wallet version doesn't work for me on OSX. For some reason Bitdefender finds a virus in it, deletes it, and then I can't use native mode.)

[11-Jun-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> I was using 2.35 and was happy with it. I shouldn't have updated 😭

[11-Jun-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> Glad to know I'm not the only one. Thanks @Acura360

[11-Jun-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Acura360> On the official homepage there is 2.38 as a download (re @Marcauj: I was using 2.35 and was happy with it. I shouldn't have updated 😭)

[11-Jun-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Marcauj> I confirm it's 2.38 that I tried to use

[11-Jun-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[telegram] <Michael> State channels move smart contracts off the blockchain. (re @Matterbridge_kmdbot: [matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> KMD has notary nodes which can create data that performs the function of an oracle, ie. notarizations, MoM, that enables the cross chain contracts. As far as state channels go, what exactly is meant by that and what functionality does it enable that is not possible otherwise?)

[11-Jun-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> since we dont have any single giant blockchain, there is no need to use a state channel to move smart contract off the blockchain. our lack of it is not any disadvantage

[11-Jun-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> in some sense all state for all contracts can be moved to any other chain in the cluster via MoMoM proofs, so there is the equivalent of state channels

[11-Jun-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> just not exactly a state channel

[11-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <RyanWaterfall> Just to keep some of our members updated KMD is still making up good on Revain and CoinMarketCap.

[11-Jun-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[telegram] <Bushybro> No one in traditional finance expects the kind of returns people in crypto do.  They are willing to wait years for 10-15% returns.  I know crypto is a bit different but most are spoiled by late 2017 early 2018 bullrun....hate to break it to y'all but that is not the norm.  I would be very happy if it happened again which it probably would but I rather have organic growth that doesn't disappear with every BTC dip.
