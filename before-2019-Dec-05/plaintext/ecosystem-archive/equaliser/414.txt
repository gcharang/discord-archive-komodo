[dscrdeql] <cryptic1> @✌Jellysmash✌ Mainly inventory tracking. Because it's a highly regulated industry everything probably gets counted a hundred times before it's sold at least. All of these numbers get transferred over to the state, and the system is archaic to say the least.

[dscrdeql] <c2k> wow, nice set up there!
for cold brew you grind your beans...add about 4x water...steep in fridge for 24hours shaking a few times...then filter.

[08-Sep-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763

If you could buy a home with crypto at a significant discount of what current real estate listings are going for, would you? If yes, then you should load up on @OfficialEQL while it’s cheap. Houses are going up regardless, just figured you all should know.

[08-Sep-18 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> It will happen but only when it’s time

[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> that would be amazing

[08-Sep-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> exciting designs

[08-Sep-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> this is possible due to the large area without requiring internal structural walls that is one of the main benefits of the geodesic dome design

[08-Sep-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> It's good that equaliser well build bigger homes for the wealthy as well as smaller places for those on a cheaper budget.

[08-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> Either way they will be drastically cheaper than traditional style homes

[08-Sep-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <✌Jellysmash✌> exciting times

[08-Sep-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> Creating a balance between the two is crucial to what we are trying to achieve

[08-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdeql] <CowboyCrypto- Founder> This will be our cheapest dome
