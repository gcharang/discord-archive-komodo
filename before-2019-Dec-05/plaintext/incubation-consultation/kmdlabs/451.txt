Block 77777 on LABS 游꾾

[22-Jul-19 07:33 PM] Alright#0419
Just a bit of a status update I guess, I've been swamped with getting HempCoin up and running. Just about finished with this, so I will have significantly more time to devote to LABS shortly. 

My todo list for LABS right now is 
test joker's qt wallet on osx, windows and linux
test out viability of using VRSC's utxo splitter for pos64 staking 
test pos64staker on windows/osx and clean it up in general 
get LABS added to atomicdex mobile and run some bobs
speak with joker on progress of lotto CC, this is likely "ready enough" for a LABS chain 

Also, I realize prices CC focus kind of died down. Tony and I had been leading this effort, but atomicdex and nspv testing took precedence. We're likely to boot this up again, but we need to do  quite a bit of prep work to get it ready for a LABS chain. Have a feeling this will have to wait until after nspv testing as jl is focused mostly on nspv for the time being. 

If there is anything else that needs doing, please just let me know. Should have HempCoin fully settled within a few days, and have some more time to devote to LABS.

[22-Jul-19 07:37 PM] Alright#0419
Also Zaddex is ready to list us whenever we give them the go ahead, just seems like a bad idea to split volume in two atm

[22-Jul-19 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
or it's a good idea, kinda depends on exposure 游뱡游낗

[22-Jul-19 07:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
in a market where vaporware tokens are ubiquitous. actually having some working code would probably hurt the price.

[22-Jul-19 07:43 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
lol

[22-Jul-19 08:07 PM] Bernz - Selling LABS#9130
The volume on graviex is laughable I've taken a large majority of every trade on the KMD market, I think putting it on zaddex would be perfect in this time frame where atomicdex isnt fully up and running, and they seem to have kmd/btc/arrr/zexo base pairs

[23-Jul-19 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
Is anyone actually mining the cfek chains and my node is moofed or did everyone just stop?

[23-Jul-19 08:11 AM] CMaurice#1685
think everyone stopped, certainly I did

[23-Jul-19 12:03 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm staking on another node, but dont tend to mine on my Labs NN

[24-Jul-19 10:54 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm working with nSPV a bit, was gonna try with LABS. Need to run jl777/FSM daemon to launch, recon there'll be compatibility issues? If so, will we be integrating nSPV?

[24-Jul-19 11:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I can merge nSPV down. I was going to start on that, but fixing the paymentsCC first.

[24-Jul-19 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Will merge it to the LOTTO branch I think, as I was going to make sure the new CC stuff works wit nSPV (or make it work)

[24-Jul-19 11:12 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
cool, I can help test. Already done a bit with KMD, tryna guify. All works out we can maybe have a nSPV webwallet on main site

[24-Jul-19 12:34 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator  LOTTO branch is updated with nSPV. It should work for all current LABS and CFEK chains.

Im just going to mess around with  it on CFEKLOTTO1. Read most of the code, but need to tsest it to grasp how it works better.

libnspv is easier to understand as it is much less other things in it

yes I have forked it and had a look around.  Does indeed seem quite simple.

[24-Jul-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
half the code isnt used, as it is for headers only SPV

if you can solve how to dynamically add peers, that would be great. i currently get the list of peers but i couldnt get it to add it

[24-Jul-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
once that is done, then it becomes fully decentralized as far as peers goes

[24-Jul-19 12:42 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Sure will have a go at it.

[24-Jul-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking maybe the add peers needs to be done via a dedicated thread, so to queue up new ipaddrs, but the libevent stuff seems to just magically call code. probably need to understand libevent a bit better

[24-Jul-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
btc_net_spv_post_cmd() int netspv.c has the processing of "addr" message and it has code (disabled) to btc_node_group_add_node(), but nothing happened

also if you want something easy to do, adding a "getpeerinfo" api call would be nice to have

[24-Jul-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
all the api is implemented at the end of nSPV_superlite.h, should be self-explanatory

[24-Jul-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
over time, we can migrate the useful api calls from iguana into libnspv

[25-Jul-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Lol, long day.. I finally have it all working. Making spends on KMD superlite node with 30 peers, and its pulling info from all of them randomly.

[25-Jul-19 03:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Few strange things I have seenm, but i assume that is due to non updated nodes sending bad info.

[25-Jul-19 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
nice! with more nodes, it should do more error checking. for now, i just check based on latest height being there

[25-Jul-19 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
probably need to blacklist peers that are misbehaving, stuff like that. maybe even validate the latest header links back to most recent notarization. plz make a PR to dev branch with the peer adding

[25-Jul-19 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok

```Alright Aujourd'hui  21:33
next planned notary hard fork would be prior to block 86400
so NN lottery will start around ~76320
likely a day or so prior to that```
@Alright  Hello
As we are on block 84 468, do you think that the lottery will be postponed a little bit or will it be on the blockheight you said ?

[25-Jul-19 11:50 PM] Alright#0419
@phm87 have been in a bit of a depressive state lately, could use some help putting this together. Kind of let this slip assuming someone else would be on top of it, but I'll start putting it together

[25-Jul-19 11:51 PM] Alright#0419
Is really simple to start it, can start the lottery now if everyone is fine with that

[25-Jul-19 11:52 PM] Alright#0419
Let me wait until joker is around and we'll start it as soon as he is

[25-Jul-19 11:54 PM] phm87#7395
I invited 2 friends to this (Ondalf who discussed here during elections) and d4v who is running Uni with me

[25-Jul-19 11:55 PM] phm87#7395
Let's do it tomorrow and maybe wait one day to be sure that all ppl interested picked a ticket before the winner is picked up

lottery is meant to run for 1 week, don't think we should cut it short

[26-Jul-19 12:35 AM] phm87#7395
1 week is fine. I though it was shorter. I will stop to run as a chicken without head

just wondering, is there a way to prevent people from using multiple clone accs to maximize their chance of winning ?

[26-Jul-19 08:25 AM] phm87#7395
I'd suggest KYC to avoid this

[26-Jul-19 08:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
If its a lottery - the more tickets you buy the higher the chances to win. In my opinion think its fair and Ok

[26-Jul-19 08:49 AM] PHBA2061#2530
if I understand Alright's message correctly, looks like we have the same process as the last, which means new candidates just have to create a signed message. There are no ticket yet

[26-Jul-19 12:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
So what are existed NN ops supposed to do?

[26-Jul-19 12:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
All i recall is giving Alright a pubkey when he launched STAKED

[26-Jul-19 12:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then I staked lol... end of steps for me till I launched the LABS NN.

[26-Jul-19 12:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
and is the number of NN ops increasing or staying at 22?

[26-Jul-19 01:02 PM] blackjok3r#3181
it increase by 2 ops each 2 months unless somevody leaves then it would only increase by 1

[26-Jul-19 01:45 PM] CMaurice#1685
So everyone updated and working fine? (Still not working for me)

[26-Jul-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
didn't update anything because he's been waiting for 4 days for the fek chain to move to finish his wallet cleaning

[26-Jul-19 01:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
oh, there must be something I don't understand about wallet cleaning then, or at least one thing

what do you mean @CMaurice ?

[26-Jul-19 02:00 PM] ComputerGenie 游놊游낖游닉#7004
could be that I wrote "cleaning" instead of "reset" 游땥

[26-Jul-19 02:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
I don't understand why a chain not moving would hold up wallet cleaning, assuming I know what you mean by wallet cleaning

[26-Jul-19 02:00 PM] CMaurice#1685
I mean the NN script
