Question, Will this new chain be mineable.   And can we get a mining pool link or is that now how this works?

[21-Nov-18 04:23 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I also have mined staked before but I never figured out how to get it out my CLI is that no longer useable or should I try to save it somehow?  Sorry for now getting on board sooner.

[21-Nov-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
the main chain will be 49% proof of work

[21-Nov-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
so yes it's minable

[21-Nov-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
will be the same experience as mining any other coin

[21-Nov-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
I can help you recover what you did mine so far Fishy if you still have the wallet

[21-Nov-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
is really simple

[21-Nov-18 04:27 AM] Alright#0419
ok can someone confirm that 53.5 hours from now is Friday 10 AM UTC

[21-Nov-18 04:27 AM] Alright#0419
fucking timezones man

[21-Nov-18 04:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I really am not sure... tbh .. every one can just have notary ready, then set a crontab for the time on start.sh and it shold work ... id rather do it manually though

[21-Nov-18 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I got it crond so all good here

[21-Nov-18 04:36 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
53.5hrs from now is 6pm at gmt+8

[21-Nov-18 04:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
So gmt 1000hrs

[21-Nov-18 04:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
My cron only runs every 4hrs tho... might make it abit more often...

[21-Nov-18 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
inb4 I oversleep and lose notary spot

[21-Nov-18 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
tbh I don't expect 20 people to notarize immediately

[21-Nov-18 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
expecting it to take a few hours

[21-Nov-18 04:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
neither do I ..

[21-Nov-18 04:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the chain stalls liek the last launch it will take even longer 😄

[21-Nov-18 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
what's a launch without a chain stall?

[21-Nov-18 04:41 AM] Alright#0419
they only ever stall because no one will stake them other than myself

the chain to determine mainnet notaries will start sometime after 10AM UTC Friday

[21-Nov-18 04:45 AM] Alright#0419
Pinned a message.

[21-Nov-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The era change should be done 24 before that ? to make sure it doenst break shit ?

[21-Nov-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as era change requires all iguanas to be restarted with new staked.json

[21-Nov-18 04:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
at basically the same time.

[21-Nov-18 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
"basically the same time"

[21-Nov-18 04:47 AM] Alright#0419
can you explain that

[21-Nov-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well .. if the amount of pubkeys increases ... the old notaries on the old staked.json file, wont create enough min sigs to create valid notarisations

[21-Nov-18 04:48 AM] Alright#0419
so can we script it to change the staked.json

[21-Nov-18 04:48 AM] Alright#0419
that seems to be asking for trouble if we don't

[21-Nov-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I so yes

[21-Nov-18 04:48 AM] Alright#0419
didn't consider that until just now

[21-Nov-18 04:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats why I made the era gap parameter , to give X time for all iguanas to be restarted

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] Alright#0419
ok and what is the behavior during this gap

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and any that dont restart, the ntoarisations they make are just invalid

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
all notarisaaitons are invalid

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] Alright#0419
for how long?

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Ideallyt it should only be a few mins ... teistin was 777 seconds

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it shouldnt need to be that long

[21-Nov-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if the nodes have it on a script or cron tab of some kind

[21-Nov-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe even the iguana itself should just exit at the end of an era .. not sure

[21-Nov-18 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just close

[21-Nov-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then somethign like lazy node would just restart it ... which we cna incorperate pretty easily ... just a single script on cron that checks if envery hting is running and if not it starts it agian.

[21-Nov-18 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or jsut cron start.sh like smk does

[21-Nov-18 04:52 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either that ... or stakes.json should be generated by an RPC in komodod automatically on iguana lunch ..

[21-Nov-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just issue RPC to komodod that returns the json file for the current era

[21-Nov-18 04:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but that wont know what IPs to use ..

[21-Nov-18 04:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤔

[21-Nov-18 04:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
maybe the RPC could send the ips as a parameter in the RPC returning the valid staked.json with all pubkeys for current era, and the IPs are fetched form oracle, or git (for now) ?

[21-Nov-18 05:09 AM] Alright#0419
Need to think about it, don't quite have my head wrapped around it yet

[21-Nov-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
i figured a manual process is best at first ... even if it goes really badly and take shours to begin notarising

[21-Nov-18 05:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its testnet ... then we can see hwo best to solve the issues that arise

[21-Nov-18 05:10 AM] blackjok3r#3181
right now we have eough notaries to do the era change and the existing ones would keep notarising..

[21-Nov-18 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as we are only adding not removing anyone

[21-Nov-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
depends how many changed keys though...

[21-Nov-18 05:13 AM] blackjok3r#3181
either way era change should e a good 24H before the new chain launches... byt the time the chain launches everyone should be up to date.

[21-Nov-18 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if not they wont notarise

[21-Nov-18 05:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think having komodod create hte staked.json is a great idea though, that saves a lot of possible human error ... I think I will give that a go later today if I get a chance it wont be difficult at all.

[21-Nov-18 06:17 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
So - I am slightly confused (doesn't take much)
The new chain will replace CFEK and have a few new CFEK### type side chains.
Like EFEK with EFEKED and EFEKING (although probably best to use equal length names to avoid JQ white space issues)
 If this is the case - why would ERA change be needed - isn't that linked to CFEK?

[21-Nov-18 06:20 AM] Alright#0419
@Bar_F1sh_Rel we'll be creating (possibly) the last CFEK chain prior to launch in about 2 days

[21-Nov-18 06:20 AM] Alright#0419
we need to add all the pubkeys of anyone who signed up to ERA2 of CFEK testnet

[21-Nov-18 06:20 AM] Alright#0419
first 20 people to notarize this new CFEK chain will keep their pubkey for LABS

[21-Nov-18 06:21 AM] Alright#0419
that answer your question?

[21-Nov-18 06:21 AM] Alright#0419
This chain is going to test the 10% to notary mechanism as well

[21-Nov-18 06:28 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - so it's something like CFEKLAST getting added to the cluster, with an ERA change sometime tomorrow to activate the code change with the notaries on the CFEK chain - this should allow testing that a new notary can notarise ahead of time on existing chains.
As long as I have KMD and CFEK coin, run start.sh after the .json is upated with the CFEKLAST parameters and then start iguana to activate notarisations  all is good.

[21-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Alright#0419
yes

[21-Nov-18 10:42 AM] CMaurice#1685
OK, great. Now, I don't like to do this not just because  suggesting how people should do things is problematic, but... I think I've found a tool that could be useful for the project and  perhaps the wider komodoverse. Basically it enables a reductionist command line language, simplifying complex commands: https://github.com/casey/just/blob/master/justfile

[21-Nov-18 10:43 AM] CMaurice#1685
I trust this tool because it is used in the clip-os project, and they've presumably done some security work on it.

[21-Nov-18 10:44 AM] CMaurice#1685
I found it though their docs.

[21-Nov-18 10:46 AM] CMaurice#1685
To skim that rather large page, read the first bit at the top and # further-ramblings at the bottom

[21-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CMaurice#1685
it would've been nice that time if @jl777c  could've said `just build jl777 FSM` ffs

[21-Nov-18 10:47 AM] CMaurice#1685
let me know what you think

[21-Nov-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM currently is broken, use jl777 branch

[21-Nov-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
we expect a fix to the addressindex rpc tomorrow, after that the CC will work again

[21-Nov-18 10:56 AM] CMaurice#1685
So, in that event a `git pull` of the repo would've updated the justfile, which the dev would have changed to make any `just build` commands to build the jl777 branch. Hopefully I got that right.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢 👆 I hope you don't mind me highlighting you

[21-Nov-18 11:18 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@CMaurice I use a similar concept in almost every script I write

[21-Nov-18 11:24 AM] CMaurice#1685
neat, thanks, now I'm wondering about failures in `just` commands

[21-Nov-18 11:25 AM] CMaurice#1685
I suppose it'd be no different from the way things are in staked/labs, where scripts do much error management

[21-Nov-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I've never tried using it like you suggest (never really thought of it), not sure how you'd do error handling with that many possible events

[21-Nov-18 11:27 AM] CMaurice#1685
yeah, trying to think that through atm, think it'll take some practical use and experience and trials, will do so after we have kmdlabs up and running

[21-Nov-18 11:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
probably not a good idea to call scripts from justfiles

[21-Nov-18 11:28 AM] CMaurice#1685
we'll see

[21-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The staked repo scripts are 99% error handling .. and tbh its a bit overkill... but to make it noob friendly I had to at elast try and make it so that invalid inputs were impossible.

[21-Nov-18 11:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
they are still not impossible ... but at least its very close, that if you follow direcrtions and miss a step it tells your what its wrong most of the time.

[21-Nov-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am working out of mastertest btw ... it may or may not build for a while... not that anyone should be using it.

[21-Nov-18 11:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I already found a few bugs, by just glossing over some code lookign for something else.
