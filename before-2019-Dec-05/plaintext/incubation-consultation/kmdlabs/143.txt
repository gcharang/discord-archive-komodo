that code in main.cpp

[04-Dec-18 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
then
    if (ptx)
    {
        SyncWithWallets(*ptx, &block);
    }

[04-Dec-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so adding a check for PoS64 staking to the:                     if (i == (block.vtx.size() - 1) && ASSETCHAINS_LWMAPOS && block.IsVerusPOSBlock() && state.GetRejectReason() == "staking")

[04-Dec-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
that could fix it

[04-Dec-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool thanks

[04-Dec-18 02:40 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will give this a go.

[04-Dec-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
actually this makes sense, I guess its adding the tx back to the mempool when the block was invalid. Not quite sure why that breaks the wallet, but it does explain why there are rouge staking txs in PoW blocks.

[04-Dec-18 02:44 PM] blackjok3r#3181
So it needs fixing anyway.

[04-Dec-18 04:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
@jl777c  I mesaged miket but havent heard back... I dont think that is related. Although I think I have found an answer fixing it seems difficult... 
Theory is this, When you are the only staker this happens a lot, less so with more nodes.
The ram staker loads every 10 minutes from the wallet, but there is no way for it to clear a tx after its choses that I can see. So it can select one twice. Of course this means that the second time its chosen the block is invalid. 
Then when it disconnects tip, it removes the chosen tx from the wallet by force, with EraseTransaction (the same as I used in my wallet cleaner)
This means that the valid staked utxo now has been removed from the wallet and cannot be an input for the next tx seen.

[04-Dec-18 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
this also explains the null pwaleltin relay transactio0n crash

[04-Dec-18 04:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
that was introduced after the ram staker

[04-Dec-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
for less than 10000 utxo, the ramstaker should behave as it would without

[04-Dec-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have more than 10000 utxo?

[04-Dec-18 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#3181
one chain has 10,000 the rest have 5000 ish ... but there might be lots and lots of dust utrxo that are not eleghible as the block reward is 0 on these chains.

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
and I am mining nearly all the blocks

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if it selects the same one twice, then it wouldnt be valid

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can test by changing the 10000 utxo limit to 25000

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] jl777c#5810
see if that stabilizes the behavior

👌 

[04-Dec-18 04:57 PM] blackjok3r#3181
the only place is removes the tx fromt he wallet to cause a missing vin error on load is in dissconnect tip in main.cpp

[04-Dec-18 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it is disconnecting the tip, it should add it back into the wallet? not remove

[04-Dec-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
its removing the tx that staked the block, so maybe thats not even the right place

[04-Dec-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
as it should not select one of those txs

[04-Dec-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#3181
to stake

[04-Dec-18 05:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
will try to just increase ram staker to some huge value to disable it and do zapwallet

[04-Dec-18 05:00 PM] blackjok3r#3181
then leave for a day

[04-Dec-18 05:46 PM] blackjok3r#3181
acept to memory pool errors are not related to wallet corruption.

Staking VPS up and running - just starting to fund it.
Any requests on the funding method? @blackjok3r

[04-Dec-18 07:27 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Make sure u have 100 utxos that are over 10 in size on each chain

[04-Dec-18 07:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I just changed some code on mine and restarted with rescanned wallet's

[04-Dec-18 07:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Hope it fixes the corrupt wallet issue but likely that would be lucky if it does

[04-Dec-18 07:29 PM] blackjok3r#3181
You should split over 64 segids but I'm quite sure mine are all in the same address here

[04-Dec-18 07:30 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u can get a paste bin of any failed migrate logs for me , I will check those out tomorrow

[04-Dec-18 07:31 PM] blackjok3r#3181
DM if u need to, shouldn't be anything about priv keys as the logs only Dave export tx and afterwards which is already fully signed.

CFEK is funded now - just setting some migrates off to fund the others.

[04-Dec-18 11:09 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Cool that'd what I did... All my chains are just thousands of migrate txs as utxos

[04-Dec-18 11:11 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I will leave my staker up most of the day and get another up on ducks, as I need to work on staking scripts, once yours is going g smoothly and we know the chain s won't stall I'll start migrating. If yours check out ok, we should hard fork the cluster 102 to sapling on its own branch and teat everything there

[04-Dec-18 11:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Migrates and anything else we can think of, been holding off on sapling activation for us waiting for the oraclels fix

[04-Dec-18 11:14 PM] blackjok3r#3181
Unless they need help to fix that...

is there a way to list utxo qty by cli?

[04-Dec-18 11:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=CHAIN listunspent | jq '.|length'`

[04-Dec-18 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
I say 100 utxo, because they thake 100 blocks to mature but at 1% pos it can be less, we just cannot have the chain stall so 100 is the go, my advice is to send 1 large sum then send many it to yourself

[04-Dec-18 11:22 PM] blackjok3r#3181
If u need a script to build send many jsons I can post one

[04-Dec-18 11:24 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834

Hi @LabsAssistant, thanks to those who voted, gave feedback and made submissions on the proposed KMDLabs logo.
 Could you please give a `yea` or `nay` on the following. 
It's based on the submission that received the most positive feedback with a change of letter coloring, as was suggested.
The below are all the same logo, just set on different backgrounds to give an idea of how it will look.
Please note, your yes/no vote is for the logo, not the background.
Thanks 🙂

Here is a cute presentation by some Hyperledger Sawtooth Lake devs about fish tracking.  The basic concepts there can be deployed in many sectors of our CC tools.  The Hyperledger devs will soon find the limitations of their platform choice.  Komodo has been wisely planned to avoid all of the pitfalls the others are bumping their heads on today.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oxOas6cFXE

Of course their promo stuff will never admit their challenges.  It is just so nice to have a platform that has been built from the ground up in such a way that the problems other ledgers will see do not enter the reality of Komodo blockchains.

[05-Dec-18 03:02 AM] axo777#1232
It appears that they are placing active RFID's on each fish caught.  While this is OK, it probably is not necessary.  All we really need is location information on the fishing vessel which is a GPS signal.  The skipper can issue a blanket barcode or QR code for the complete haul.  Sensors will transmit temperature and other data while on the fishing vessel. Then at port the fish will be processed and packed. At port individual package codes are generated at the palleting stage and uploaded to the blockchain.  Tracking continues for onward transportation by associating the smaller package Bar/QR Codes with the pallets (or equal) they are riding on or in until final delivery to the retail store. (This is in the case of fish, similar sequences apply for other products).  We can bribe the retail consumer with a few AXO's to scan and report their purchase or oonsumption of the fish with our smart phone "Report App" that signals to the Oracle that the supply chain is complete.  When the retail store receives the shipment payment can be triggered via a number of possible events all of which are reported by the oracle to the blockchain.  One possible event is crossing a "geofence" our user would set up on our platform.  (The geofence comes to us via an API from our GPS and cell network signal partner.

@CrisF Definitly the black one (on dark backgrounds), but I would have prefered a bolder font for the "KMD" part, and a solid color too

[05-Dec-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I htink these are what we chose ... so they are final. I think they turned out good. exile did a great job on them

[05-Dec-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
We are testing a few last things, and will have a hardfork in the next day to activate sapling on half of our chains.

[05-Dec-18 06:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
not updating in time will mean you need to resync your chains most likely.

[05-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Hmmmm - looks like I have feked my migrate scripts somehow on the clone VPS - not a single migrate completed last night.
a tui script just worked though - so it must be me.

master or noStreamer

[05-Dec-18 06:43 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
everything should be on master - pulled from stakedchain

also - why is processor load so high for staking?

[05-Dec-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mining nodes are on sapling activated build

[05-Dec-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
its always been like that

[05-Dec-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
as far as I can tell, its because its calculating an equihash solution

[05-Dec-18 06:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only a very low dificulty one

[05-Dec-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but it still pegs a core, when it has utxo's that are elegible to stake.

[05-Dec-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be 1 core only per daemon.

[05-Dec-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181

yeah - just to get things running

[05-Dec-18 06:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ok cool.. just checking as thats where all the errors are

[05-Dec-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and my node went off on a 124 block reorg somehow

[05-Dec-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so I am guessing another node not on sapling

[05-Dec-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
mined a block

[05-Dec-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and it all went haywire.

[05-Dec-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it seems import txs maybe are not sapling activated.

[05-Dec-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
should be able to get that fixed

[05-Dec-18 06:48 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
hmmm - so random imports will work depending on miner?

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think so yes... but you will find that after 1 confirm ... they will reorg

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and no longer be there

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the sciptt will say

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
import confirmed

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but hen a block later

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it wont be confirmed any more

[05-Dec-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and the tx will get orphaned.
