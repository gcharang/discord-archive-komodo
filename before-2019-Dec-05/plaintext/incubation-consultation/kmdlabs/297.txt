Yes, I'll have to do that.

@CrisF did you try dwy_attack_migration

[17-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Alright#0419
basically what it does is combine utxos then do cleanwallettransactions

[17-Feb-19 03:30 PM] gt#2812
is there any easy way to start blocknotify

[17-Feb-19 03:54 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in conf file

[17-Feb-19 03:57 PM] Alright#0419
@gt what are you trying to use blocknotify for?

[17-Feb-19 04:00 PM] gt#2812
was just looking at the staker

[17-Feb-19 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
if you use the `restart` branch, there's an option for `Restart daemon with -blocknotify` in the TUI

[17-Feb-19 04:07 PM] Alright#0419
literally working on it right now, if you have time to test please do

{Reactions}
👍 

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
right now if you close the TUI, it will kill the daemon

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
working on fixing that right now

[17-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Alright#0419
Ah sweet, just found the fix. I'll push it in a moment

[17-Feb-19 06:55 PM] CMaurice#1685
not sure if something wrong but added gen, genproclimit to LABSTH.conf to mine and I seem to be getting a much greater reward than I'd expect given the 11:3000 odd local to chain hashps

[17-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
networksols is garbage on a POS chain

[17-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
if you're looking at the number in getinfo

[17-Feb-19 06:57 PM] CMaurice#1685
oic, yep

[17-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
it's complete garbage I believe

[17-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
we need to figure out a way to properly estimate it

[17-Feb-19 06:57 PM] Alright#0419
shouldn't be that hard

[18-Feb-19 01:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure that's possible but I'll look at it today and see if it's not too hard

[18-Feb-19 02:52 AM] CrisF#3405
@Alright Hi, Yes, I did `dwy_attack_mitigation` after the attack.  Also again last night.
I just tried again now and get ```{
  "total_transactons": 28448,
  "remaining_transactons": 28448,
  "removed_transactions": 0
}
```

[18-Feb-19 02:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Been trying a `z_mergetoaddress` but having trouble getting that working.

[18-Feb-19 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
dwy just does z_mergetoaddress

[18-Feb-19 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you need to do an actual wallet reset

[18-Feb-19 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
send the entire balance tgo yourself... Also that dwy script doesnt wait for a confirm

[18-Feb-19 04:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
so the cleanwalletransactions wont work rightawy until its confirmed

[18-Feb-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Tried to look at that networkhash per second thing. Cant be fixed

[18-Feb-19 04:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The way it calcualtes it there is no possible way to make it skip all staking blocks. I tried that and it gave an even higher value 😂

[18-Feb-19 05:00 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It could be done using percpos, but the code overhead isn't worth the meaningless stat imo

[18-Feb-19 05:02 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yeah its totally pointless, it would be easier to poll each pool for the info 😃 Provided we have that avalible... The staking script assums you solo mine if you want to do both though... So doubt msot hash will be on public pools.

[18-Feb-19 05:09 AM] CrisF#3405
@blackjok3r  I've been getting this when attempting to send to self ```Error: The transaction was rejected! This might happen if some of the coins in your wallet were already spent, such as if you used a copy of wallet.dat and coins were spent in the copy but not marked as spent here.```

[18-Feb-19 05:09 AM] CrisF#3405
Will zapwallet and see how that goes.

[18-Feb-19 05:11 AM] blackjok3r#3181
zapwallet will work the best, could take a while though... I cron cleanwallettransactions on my notaries every 6H... I think something like dwy script to merge notary payments, utxo splitter and clean wallettransactions RPC will be needed in some order for optimal preformance. Everything is there, cant make it too easy for all nodes 😉

[18-Feb-19 05:12 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also it appears having open ports does help, noticed on a-team notary that forcing absolutly stupid connection counts on all daemons significantly increase notarization preformance..

[18-Feb-19 05:13 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`could take a while though...`
not near as long as when I run it on MGNX 😛

at the cost of vastly increase network bandwidth that is...

[18-Feb-19 05:13 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm mostly thinking how to fix it and see how that effects notarizations.  I'm getting virtually none.

[18-Feb-19 05:14 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the wallet is the number one thing that affects counts, of you can keep it under 50 tx all the time you will do 1000x better than if its on 10,000 txns

[18-Feb-19 05:15 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, 28000 is a bit much, haha.

[18-Feb-19 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ha yeah, not realy that many.. main net notaries have like 100,000 and more... Keeping on top it is imperative really, its waaaayyy too much down time when it gets broken. There is 1 trick though:
delete wallet.dat
import notary private key with `"" false` 
then use z_import key on a random z address specifying the last 50,000 blocks only. then run

[18-Feb-19 05:16 AM] blackjok3r#3181
clean wallet transaction with no txid.

[18-Feb-19 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you cant use start.sh to do this, it will import key with rescan by default

[18-Feb-19 05:17 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I tried to make it do the above automatically, but I faild, it was too complicated

{Reactions}
🙏 

[18-Feb-19 05:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks man!

[18-Feb-19 05:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Will do.

[18-Feb-19 05:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
good luck.... with z address missing from KMD now, i wonder how it will go... lket me know if z_import key no longer works, and I can add rescan height to importprivkey

[18-Feb-19 05:19 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I was wondering if that was why I was having trouble with `z_mergetoaddress`.

[18-Feb-19 05:20 AM] CrisF#3405
If so I'll miss a few of those `z_...`

[18-Feb-19 05:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Are you able to add any rpc?

[18-Feb-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
z_mergetoaddress doesnt take coinbase by default

[18-Feb-19 05:20 AM] blackjok3r#3181
umm what for exactly? sadly there is no way to make a `fixstupidbtcwallet` rpc 😂

{Reactions}
😂 

[18-Feb-19 05:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Is it possible to make a `sendfrom <ADRRESS (rather than account>` like can be done with `z_sendmany`? Or is that only possible with z-transactions?

[18-Feb-19 05:24 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmmm that does sound like it would be very useful

[18-Feb-19 05:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but I thought z_sendmany could already do this ?

[18-Feb-19 05:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it can.  Not sure if does anymore.

[18-Feb-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ahh yes. becuase of z tx being disabled on KMD.. I think it would still work... let me check this what works and what doesnt.

[18-Feb-19 05:27 AM] CrisF#3405
There's one more that I haven't seen but would find very useful.
`removeaddressfromaccount`

[18-Feb-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
like a way to remove an address from the wallet?

[18-Feb-19 05:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
thats probably quite easy, would be similar code to the clean wallet loop, but checking address instead of txid.

[18-Feb-19 05:28 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes.

[18-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
hmm remove address could be dangerous... maybe it sould dumpthe private key then remove the address. 🤔

[18-Feb-19 05:32 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just incase mistakes....

[18-Feb-19 05:34 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, I was wondering.  Seems like it would be very useful, but since not already implemented there must be a good reason.

[18-Feb-19 05:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if feasible, and/or maybe a warning there are funds in the address?

[18-Feb-19 05:37 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
wouldnt the address pool from a deterministic seed phrase render that useless in most cases?

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that is a nice idea... I think iguana maybe has code for that not 100% sure.... maybe thats just a single address

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure I fully understand @smk762 -  dracocanis ominator , but I have imported some addresses I now regret.

[18-Feb-19 05:38 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
yeah removing imported addresses would be useful....

[18-Feb-19 05:39 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I will just start on being able to load 2 wallets.... it should be possible then to just have a totally seperate wallet.dat for the notary address.... This makes 100% sure that is is always clean, but you can still actaully use the node for other stuff...

[18-Feb-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
OK will make RPC to remove address's

[18-Feb-19 05:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
this wont take long at all

[18-Feb-19 05:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
just give it address it will return private key and amount of tx removed, abd maybe a total balance for that address if thats easy enough... if it had balance and you screwed it up, just have to reimport it. 😃

`There's one more that I haven't seen but would find very useful. removeaddressfromaccount`
@CrisF to what end would that be useful?

[18-Feb-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
make new wallet, import all other than the addresses you want removed

[18-Feb-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
there is code to remove address, but it is not enabled as it seems way to easy to lose funds

[18-Feb-19 05:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
cant it not just dump the private key ?

[18-Feb-19 05:45 AM] CrisF#3405
I have somehow imported a watchonly address that really is annoying.  Also imported addresses and have old ones I'd like to get rid off. @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

[18-Feb-19 05:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
doesnt seem that unsafe, but yes my first thaughts were that aswell, ifg i enable this and someon loses funds... this could be very bad

[18-Feb-19 05:45 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`make new wallet, import all other than the addresses you want removed`
that was going to be my suggestion: dumpwallet, remove the 1 line, importwallet

thats a LOT slower ona  wallet with 30k tx in it

[18-Feb-19 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think cris idea is fin, as long as it dumps the private key incase of OP error

[18-Feb-19 05:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that way your only wasting hours of time rescanning, if you screw it up

[18-Feb-19 05:46 AM] CrisF#3405
If there is an easy way already in place I can just do that.

[18-Feb-19 05:47 AM] CrisF#3405
I was curious why there wasn't already such a feature.

[18-Feb-19 05:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181

[18-Feb-19 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
which is why it can just dump the private key and thats no longer an issue

[18-Feb-19 05:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
🤷

[18-Feb-19 05:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`unimportwallet`

[18-Feb-19 05:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
now also if he's only reralyl worried about watchinly... we can make ti just remove watchonly .. which is much better again

[18-Feb-19 05:50 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
needs private key to run

[18-Feb-19 05:50 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
except for having a txt file with a privkey for 100k coins for however long it takes you to realize

[18-Feb-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
look if my users request a featur and it will litterally takwe 15mins to add it... why not addd it?

[18-Feb-19 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that works... remove address by private key! thanks
