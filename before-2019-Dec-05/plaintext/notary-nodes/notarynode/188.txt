please dont steal all my pizza and beer

[04-May-19 02:31 AM] Alright#0419
in all seriousness, do not do that

[04-May-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
I realize the updates now are annoying, but they're much less frequent on mainnet

[04-May-19 02:32 AM] Alright#0419
much more important on mainnet as well

[04-May-19 02:32 AM] Greer#0666
I'd never on mainnet

[04-May-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
I think we should jump back to 7 sigs honestly

[04-May-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
I'll talk to jl about it when he's around

[04-May-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
I think if we still have double notarizations that indicates the closed ports were not the problem

[04-May-19 02:33 AM] Alright#0419
if we don't it indicates that they were(maybe - more testing)

i'm taking this timeout to cleanup my stuff without the 6hr ranking pressure

[04-May-19 02:59 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I was already fighting issues so this latest network hiccup confused me twice

[04-May-19 03:00 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ran git pull and m_notary_testnt soon after last request, think I forgot to hit the check though.. I'll make it a point to in the future

[04-May-19 03:41 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I want to do the job right too @CrisF isn't always totally clear how at times though. I'm working to improve troubleshooting / upkeep checklists / automation scripts.. learning github along the way has thrown me at times

[04-May-19 05:44 AM] mrlynch#5735
@CrisF good rant, but i don't think we're failing as a team tbf. testnet should be for breaking things and improvements and i think we're doing a pretty good job.. along with the heated debates that we've had pretty good things have come out of this and i start to feel a comaradery being born here

notable achievements so far: wallet filter being pushed upstream after being battle tested, notarywiki being worked on, valuable knowledge being passed to n00bs (myself included), hunting down various bugs (or "normal" anomalies) such as this double nota thing

[04-May-19 05:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
all in all good job @deleted-role you're doing great you fabulous bastards 👌

[04-May-19 05:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
also testing the notifications :troll: :troll_rage:

[04-May-19 05:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Dr.Terminus & @mrlynch ,
I agree that we are all doing our best, and that many good things have come out of our experiences here.
From my perspective, this seems like a squad of firefighters in the station preparing and organizing their gear, meanwhile a nearby house is burning down though. 
As a testnet I see this current situation as a great opportunity to also improve.  As the simulated attack was.

[04-May-19 05:57 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I missed the update last night, but did it when wakeup about 5hrs ago.
Agree that perhaps testnet participants that kinda disappeared once bounties paid is a piss poor effort. Hang around and learn. I see a few gave up on being voted in too. Learn, next year you'll be ready.

[04-May-19 05:58 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
props to all who added, tweaked scripts, PR'd info to readme and populated CG's wiki with relevant info

[04-May-19 05:59 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
if I had tipfunds left, this is where I'd start trowing them about 😄

[04-May-19 06:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
for the record, not that long ago I was the noob who was keen to run for NN, but wasnt ready. Learned a fair bit since, and have a lot left to learn because KMD dev never fkn stops!

[04-May-19 06:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
To the keen initiates, report to #kmdlabs, and checkout the PaymentsCC game
keep an ear out for the bugle and report to  muster often enough, you'll be a veteran soon enough

[04-May-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
if notarizations are happenning, why change minsigs? you want it the largest value that gets consistent notarizations

[04-May-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and at 7, that is very small and it is possible to have 20+ notaries very quickly settle on two separate notarizations

[04-May-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
7 is too small

[04-May-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
7 is too small

[04-May-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you want to use 7?

[04-May-19 06:35 AM] Alright#0419
my understanding was that double notarizations were an unexpected bug. Are you saying they're bound to happen with low enough min sigs?

[04-May-19 06:36 AM] Alright#0419
I tried to find an example on a mainnet chain and could not. Was simply trying to understand why they happened

[04-May-19 06:40 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
k, so why do @CrisF  and I get differnt response, and there are  > 7 matching on each discrete list, but still no ntx?

[04-May-19 06:40 AM] Alright#0419
min sigs is at 11

[04-May-19 06:45 AM] PHBA2061#2530
bestmatches needs to reach 11 in order for notarizations to take place

[04-May-19 06:45 AM] CrisF#3405
We've been assuming that this 15 hours with no notarizations is due to updates.  Do you think it could involve something wlse?

strange, bestmatches drop back to 9-10 ...

[04-May-19 09:06 AM] Strob#3417
Mmmh that 🍕 was good, now I'm hungry and thirsty! Maybe since there was no precise date for the end of the test, some people just assumed they will participate less after their vote is secured. On my part I am planning to kind of stop the test after election is done (I mean stop aiming for the highest notary count) and then I will concentrate on preparing for mainnet if I am elected. Does that make sense?

[04-May-19 09:10 AM] Strob#3417
In fact it would be good to have a testnet always running just to try and break stuff and since labs is limited to a few people where can we do some testing after this test ends?

[04-May-19 09:44 AM] NNoperator#3835

[04-May-19 09:44 AM] NNoperator#3835

I couldn't find it in search, I though @Mylo  might have more that one testnode running here in testnet.

[04-May-19 10:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Even accounting for that in dead ips 33 sounds a lot.

we have bestk.20 on txs.. let's see

nope

[04-May-19 11:21 AM] mrlynch#5735
bestmatches.10 😒

[04-May-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if bestmatches.10 is the highest it goes, then minsigs of 10 would be the most that would notarize

[04-May-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
when doing hardforking change, changing the port is sometimes the best way

{Reactions}
🤔 

[04-May-19 11:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Would the minsig number of notaries but the minimum required for a port change?

[04-May-19 11:24 AM] CrisF#3405
(assuming all wern't available)

[04-May-19 11:25 AM] CrisF#3405
@PHBA2061 , are you also seeing `000000000000000000 TXSCLCC.000`s?
