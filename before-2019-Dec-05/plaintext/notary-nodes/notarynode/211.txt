all i do is output all iguana log to `iguana.log` and tail that along with @webworker01's `stats` script. iguana TV is very addictive

[29-May-19 11:11 PM] SHossain#0007
and the only TV i like to watch

[29-May-19 11:16 PM] SHossain#0007
and, to be honest as long as you have your seed safe, you can always put things back together in a fresh state. in other words `fresh start`

Excuse me but can anyone else on mainnet please confirm that the 
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7776" --data "{\"method\":\"walletpassphrase\",\"params\":[\"$passphrase\", 9999999]}"
```
call will return the same result for `$passphrase` = either your 24 seed words or compressed WIF ? I tested it on StakedNotary & testnet iguana, both return the same results for seed words & WIF attached to the same private key, but I'm not sure how it works on mainnet, I'm asking this question because I only use WIF atm 😅

[30-May-19 01:31 AM] Greer#0666
I'm looking at `komodo/src/assetchains.old` vs `komodo/src/assetchains` assuming this is just another personal preference thing?  Is there an updated assetchains.json or a way to generate one or do I manually update that.

[30-May-19 01:32 AM] Greer#0666
I kinda like the assetchains over assetchains.old

[30-May-19 01:38 AM] Greer#0666
gonna try the hush3 from there too, seems like thats where it should be

[30-May-19 01:39 AM] Strob#3417
@Greer Are you syncing all chains now? Can you check if CHIPS is syncing for you? I got 0 connections so it's not synching.

[30-May-19 01:40 AM] Greer#0666
I am, will check, hold up

yup, same 0 connections.  I didn't open ports yet though.

[30-May-19 01:43 AM] Greer#0666
the assetchains.json maintained in a repo?  I seemed to remember seeing a python script that generated that but could be mistaken, been a lot to take in this past month

[30-May-19 01:49 AM] Strob#3417
One of the node we are adding for CHIPS seems to be down: 74.208.210.191

[30-May-19 01:59 AM] Strob#3417
About hush, if I go in the hush3/src folder and use "hush-cli" is is the same as using "komodo-cli -ac_name=HUSH3" from any folder?

[30-May-19 02:04 AM] Greer#0666
take a look at that file, its a bash script

[30-May-19 02:04 AM] Greer#0666
as was pointed out to me earlier

[30-May-19 02:04 AM] Greer#0666
I'm just going to add it to assetchains and see if it runs like the others.  cant see why it wouldn't

[30-May-19 02:09 AM] Greer#0666
oh I see, its using its own komodod and komodo-cli.  well I'll give it a try with the beta branch see what happens

[30-May-19 02:11 AM] Strob#3417
ok so it might not be the same.

[30-May-19 02:12 AM] Strob#3417
Hi @webworker01 Do you know how to make CHIPS to sync? Any node I could add to get some connections?

[30-May-19 02:18 AM] Strob#3417
CHIPS now syncing with 16 connections! 🥂

{Reactions}
🕺🏻 

[30-May-19 02:44 AM] Strob#3417
To check rapidly if all my chains are finished synching:

[30-May-19 02:44 AM] Strob#3417
```CSS
~/komodo/src$ ./fiat-cli getinfo | egrep 'blocks|longestchain|name'
```

[30-May-19 02:46 AM] Strob#3417
In my case, only PIRATE still not at 100%

[30-May-19 03:08 AM] Strob#3417
VRSC is not in the list when I use fiat-cli...

[30-May-19 03:11 AM] Strob#3417
Does VRSC use its own komodod version like hush3?

[30-May-19 03:18 AM] Strob#3417
This VRSC is synching slowly, only at 50% (5 connections).

[30-May-19 03:30 AM] Strob#3417
you mean we can use the beta branch komodod that we use for all asset chain for vrsc and hush3 after sync?

[30-May-19 03:30 AM] Strob#3417
For VRSC I get millions of AcceptToMemory pool errors...

[30-May-19 03:31 AM] Strob#3417
joinsplit requirements not met and tx inputs not found

[30-May-19 03:33 AM] NNoperator#3835
@Strob  I saw the same errors when I was synching VRSC

[30-May-19 03:36 AM] Strob#3417
Ok. Is it normal?

[30-May-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, for some reason the mempool allows tx to enter it, even when syncing. I tried to fix that in the past but it caused more bugs

[30-May-19 03:37 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So its best to just let it reject them, and ignore the errors

[30-May-19 03:37 AM] Strob#3417
ok tx!

[30-May-19 03:38 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am porting KMD hardfork activation to some other coins. I will post update here when i have it working with CHIPS, it would be good if a few ppl can test that I didnt break it once ready. 😃

[30-May-19 03:39 AM] Strob#3417
@SHossain In your guide, you wrote:
```
Start Komodo and all assetchains including VRSC & HUSH3
cd ~/komodo/src
./komodod &
./assetchains.old
```
but HUSH3 is not in assetchain.old

[30-May-19 03:40 AM] Strob#3417
We started it earlier using hushd

[30-May-19 03:41 AM] Strob#3417
So are hush and vrsc considered 3rd party coins or asset chains?

[30-May-19 03:45 AM] NNoperator#3835
HUSH3 and VerusCoin are external coins.  But they behave like our AC

👍 

[30-May-19 03:46 AM] NNoperator#3835
you can use ``-ac_name=   `` with them

[30-May-19 03:47 AM] Strob#3417

I am missing GIN and EMC2 p2p ports. I don't get them with getinfo....

[30-May-19 04:15 AM] Strob#3417
Anyone can give them to me please?

Syncing CHIPS with new notary pubkey code already, seems working fine. 
Managed to rewrite the "importaddress" code to just convert from pubkey to address in less than 35mins 😄 
Looks like mokney will be able to change KMD season for any coin withough any problems.

[30-May-19 05:26 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Anyone avalible to test this? 
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/chips3/commit/f370ec1eab4dfeb68fb921174ef46627fd10297b
Basically sync CHIPS and make sure all notarizations are showing up. 
I did mine without -txindex here just to make sure that path is working. Can someone else please try with `txindex=1`  set?

This ione is more problematic for me to test. I got it building, which was no easy task.... still didnt take too long, getting much better at this lol. 
Problem with GAME is that it syncs alll headers first, so to test this is working, will take like all day.

[30-May-19 06:35 AM] zatJUM#9924
Should we importprivkey with the second one we provided to kolo for gamecredits, emc2, gin, hush3 and vrsc? And with the 1rst one for all the others?

[30-May-19 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Not sure yet. IMO just get them running and synced. Dont do anything else. As we dont even have the proper code merged, I dont know what coins are even continueing. Just porting my easy pubkey cahnge code to all of them I am able and then we need to wait. Its VERY IMPORTANT that someone, anyone tests all this. Please dont just leave it. I had to change quite a bit of shit to get this to work.

[30-May-19 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
My plan is to make these external coins do their own work, but it has to be easy enough for them, that they can.

Last one. :D
That wasnt that bad. If it works 🤣  
GitHub wouldnt let me fork EMC2. But its a 20min job at the most ot port one of these opther coins commits to it.
