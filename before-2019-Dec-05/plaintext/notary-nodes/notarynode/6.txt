Yeah, I'm leaning towards that tbh

[27-Jun-18 06:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
that `jq` command is pretty horrific

{Reactions}
😄 

[27-Jun-18 06:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
and it also means whoever is tasting AC params can literally copy/pasta the args straight in

[27-Jun-18 06:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
rather than having to smush them into some weird array syntax

[27-Jun-18 06:14 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah that too.  wanna make it easy for the copy pastas

[27-Jun-18 06:15 AM] blackjok3r#3181
jq works... so its fine :troll:

🗣 

[27-Jun-18 06:19 AM] patchkez#5349
but this assetchainparams.txt does not contain information like p2p or rpc port, so it is quite useless for me

[27-Jun-18 06:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Afaik lazynode will just adapt whatever the args are to just continue launching with the same exact method.
It just scans the asserchains file with args but never use it so json version will work too. As long as we got some sort of db (json) with all params it will be fine

[27-Jun-18 06:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s just modifying the parsing logic

[27-Jun-18 06:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
To account for duplicate args JSON format needs to look like this:

```
cat assetchains.json
[
  [
    [
      "ac_name",
      "ZILLA"
    ],
    [
      "ac_supply",
      "11000000"
    ],
    [
      "addnode",
      "54.39.23.248"
    ]
  ],
  [
    [
      "ac_name",
      "RFOX"
    ],
    [
      "ac_supply",
      "1000000000"
    ],
    [
      "ac_reward",
      "100000000"
    ],
    [
      "addnode",
      "78.47.196.146"
    ]
  ]
]
```

[27-Jun-18 06:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's pretty nasty

[27-Jun-18 06:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it would allow adding custom meta

[27-Jun-18 06:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
like RPC port etc

[27-Jun-18 06:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
@patchkez why do you need p2p or rpc port?

[27-Jun-18 06:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Unfixed and missing params could just be a mess to loop via jq btw...

[27-Jun-18 06:29 AM] patchkez#5349
@webworker01 that is ok, but we need to have it in config file. You could have some kind of tool talking to assetchains via RPC. And it can happen quite easily that assetchains are running on multiple nodes.

[27-Jun-18 06:34 AM] patchkez#5349
```[
  {
    "ac_name": "ZILLA",
    "ac_supply": "11000000",
    "addnode": "54.39.23.248"
  },
  {
    "ac_name": "RFOX",
    "ac_supply": "1000000000",
    "ac_reward": "100000000",
    "addnode": [
                "78.47.196.146",
                "78.47.196.147",
                "78.47.196.148"
               ]

  }
]
```

[27-Jun-18 06:34 AM] patchkez#5349
@lukechilds you see above syntax as problematic?

[27-Jun-18 06:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yes, significantly harder to pass with jq

[27-Jun-18 06:35 AM] patchkez#5349
@webworker01 rpc and p2p ports are also defined in coins/*_7776 files

[27-Jun-18 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
If we were going the JSON rout it should be stored and parsed like this:

```
$ cat assetchains.json
[
  [
    [
      "ac_name",
      "ZILLA"
    ],
    [
      "ac_supply",
      "11000000"
    ],
    [
      "addnode",
      "54.39.23.248"
    ]
  ],
  [
    [
      "ac_name",
      "RFOX"
    ],
    [
      "ac_supply",
      "1000000000"
    ],
    [
      "ac_reward",
      "100000000"
    ],
    [
      "addnode",
      "78.47.196.146"
    ],
    [
      "addnode",
      "123.45.678.90"
    ]
  ]
]

$ cat assetchains.json | jq '.[] | map("-\(.[0])=\(.[1])") | reduce .[1:][] as $i ("\(.[0])"; . + " \($i)")'
"-ac_name=ZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=54.39.23.248"
"-ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 -addnode=123.45.678.90"
```

[27-Jun-18 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
simple map reduce

[27-Jun-18 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I think it should be stored as a simple TXT file

[27-Jun-18 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
Notice dupe addnode args work properly above ☝

[27-Jun-18 06:37 AM] Mylo#8306
```
[
  {
    "ac_name": "ZILLA",
    "params": [
    "ac_supply": "11000000",

```

[27-Jun-18 06:37 AM] Mylo#8306
excuse spacing, rushing out

[27-Jun-18 06:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Mylo that's not a valid JSON array

[27-Jun-18 06:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
arrays only have a list of values

[27-Jun-18 06:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
objects have property:value pairs

[27-Jun-18 06:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
but property names are unique

[27-Jun-18 06:39 AM] Mylo#8306
oic and your object same same thing you mentioned earlier will be a problem and unreadable. gotcha

[27-Jun-18 06:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you can't have dupes

[27-Jun-18 06:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
anyway guys, I'm really busy with HyperDEX dev right now

[27-Jun-18 06:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
but will try and get a PR together tonight

{Reactions}
👌 

[27-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Mylo#8306
your last example is good @lukechilds

[27-Jun-18 06:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
I still think plain text is the way to go

[27-Jun-18 06:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
that doesn't offer much over plain text

[27-Jun-18 06:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
apart from being hard to edit

[27-Jun-18 06:42 AM] Mylo#8306
csv just as easy
ac_name=zilla,addnode=1.2.3.4,addnode=2.3.4.5
using awk
then p2p port misses out

[27-Jun-18 06:42 AM] blackjok3r#3181
plain text is fine really... but p2p rpc would need to be a separate thing then.

[27-Jun-18 06:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
I still don't quite get why we need the p2p port in here

[27-Jun-18 06:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I need it... atm.. I have to maunually call getinfo then add it to firewall

[27-Jun-18 06:43 AM] Mylo#8306
central config.  but tbh not a problem in a _second_ config file 🤧

[27-Jun-18 06:44 AM] patchkez#5349
@lukechilds we aslo need it for starting docker containers, we need to tell Docker which ports to expose to the internet

[27-Jun-18 06:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
where is the p2p port set? Is it always the same for all assetchain nodes or can it be different?

[27-Jun-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can change it in confile I think, but its generated by the AC params.

[27-Jun-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
each AC has its own one.

[27-Jun-18 06:45 AM] blackjok3r#3181
or *should* have its own one.

[27-Jun-18 06:46 AM] Mylo#8306
would 2 config files work though?
csv normal for ac stuff
then commented out lines for p2p stuff

e.g.
```
ac_name=zilla,addnode=1.2.34,ac_blah=foo
ac_name=mylo,addnode=1.2.34,ac_blah=foo
#ac_name=zilla,p2p=1234,rcpport=5678
#ac_name=mylo,p2p=9000,rpcport8000

```

[27-Jun-18 06:46 AM] Mylo#8306
it's just a convention we're trying to get consensus on 😃

[27-Jun-18 06:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
if it's changeable it probably shouldn't be in here

[27-Jun-18 06:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I suppose we could have a meta property that's just for arbitrary data

[27-Jun-18 06:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
it CAN be changed... but you really should not change it..

[27-Jun-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
the other params, define its default

[27-Jun-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
You can take some of james C code and port it to whatever, and generate the p2p/rpc ports fromt he other params if you want.

[27-Jun-18 06:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
but seems pointless, if they cna just be added to the file by the chains creator.

[27-Jun-18 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you will also get a COIN_7776 file generated now, when you start the chain for first time... all the info it in that in JSON already.

[27-Jun-18 06:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[27-Jun-18 06:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
so to allow for general data to be added

[27-Jun-18 06:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
including default rpc port

[27-Jun-18 06:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
or any other key:value data

[27-Jun-18 06:50 AM] lukechilds#2707

great work. Finally someone did it onstead of talking about it. Nice work.

[27-Jun-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
wait

[27-Jun-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
thinking about it

[27-Jun-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
is there any reason that params actually need to be an array

[27-Jun-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
like is anyone really going to want to query ACs with a supply larger than x

[27-Jun-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
if not, we can get the best of both worlds

[27-Jun-18 06:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
there is all diff kinds of them, and verus has multiple values for a single param

[27-Jun-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, even more reason to not use an array

[27-Jun-18 06:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
-ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000

[27-Jun-18 06:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
could just be shortened to:

```
[
  {
    "data": {
      "rpcPort": 4321,
      "key": "value"
    },
    "params": "-ac_name=ZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=54.39.23.248"
  },
  {
    "data": {
      "rpcPort": 4321,
      "key": "value"
    },
    "params": "-ac_name=RFOX -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=78.47.196.146 -addnode=123.45.678.90"
  }
]
```

[27-Jun-18 06:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
params is just a string so can be anything

[27-Jun-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
what if we are not using some of them though like me... I dont use te addnode= on my NN.

[27-Jun-18 06:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
good point

[27-Jun-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
wihtout array I cant drop it off

[27-Jun-18 06:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well i could.. but that would get messy

@lukechilds also we should be able to add other data into that file, something like:

[27-Jun-18 07:25 AM] patchkez#5349
```{

        },
        "params": [
          [
            "ac_name",

          ],
          [

  ],
  "notary_ips:": [
    "54.39.23.249",
    "54.39.23.250"
    ]
}
```

[27-Jun-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@lukechilds  I think just move addnode to data section in you verion with no array.... as addnode is not an AC param.

[27-Jun-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you only need it for the very first sync... so put it in data, problem solved.
