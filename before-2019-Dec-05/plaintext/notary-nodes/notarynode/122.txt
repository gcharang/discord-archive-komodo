splitfunds wasn't picking up the utxo to split after funding after import false

just acsplit it

[13-Apr-19 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
basically you know you want enough utxos and take into account the fact that if you ntrz they just get consumed. splitting on a basic amount and scheduling the estimated nulber of utxos you would need is the way to go. seems utxosplitter does that thing. it may be configureable.
I d recommend at first to stick to basic call and not scripts if you want to understand

[13-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause honestly, consolidate, acsplit, manage utxos and acsplit is pretty easy to understand, the order matters.

[13-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
do it manually with 100 utxos a few days

cos ussually `MINE` means I get readout in ./stats indicating a recent ntx. Not this time

[13-Apr-19 05:01 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I restarrted a coupl hours ago

I don t recall exactly but he was able to identify bad behaviour nodes

[13-Apr-19 05:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
it remains, but those errors are supposed to be far less often than before

[13-Apr-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
sometimes I believe it s just a node restarting

[13-Apr-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
in a full ntrz round, but maybe that s not related, but it would make sense.

[13-Apr-19 05:04 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
just restarted chains, but left iguana running,

[13-Apr-19 05:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I had a question about doing that for the more experienced iguana users. Should we pause a chain in iguana before doing anything to the daemon, and restart once the daemon is fully back online? Or will iguana handle that fine automatically?

[13-Apr-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
seems to handle it fine afaik

[13-Apr-19 05:10 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
doesnt like being started without chains running tho

[13-Apr-19 05:10 AM] ch6ris#5240

How much did voters get per vote on average last year, I wonder...

[13-Apr-19 05:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The idea @ch6ris is that there is more benefit to put those funds towards development, marketing, creating projects, etc. As this would in turn make the komodo community more valuable as a whole.

@Alright implicit in my generous offer  - `vote for me or the bot gets it :gun: `

[13-Apr-19 05:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Most people are offering their time, commitment to development, allocating funds to Komodo projects (like pirate, dwy with barterlly, blackjoker and alright with LABS, smk with dragonhound)

many are putting a portion back to the ecosystem and ensuring that they can provide to the integrity of the network

[13-Apr-19 05:18 AM] ch6ris#5240
Alright, thanks everyone. So unlikely anyone offering pay per vote will win a spot.

[13-Apr-19 05:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Not necessarily, they could quite easily get a spot if they have some backing.

[13-Apr-19 05:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
there are some with rev share one up to 50% imo it does more harm than good. The funds used should be used to make the eco system stronger...
have a look at my proposal if you have time github.com/CHMEX/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/chmex

[13-Apr-19 05:21 AM] ch6ris#5240

thank you!

[13-Apr-19 05:22 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
basic logic is that you're more likely to see increased value from ecosystem growth rising KMD price that the fraction of a token you'd get from NN revshare

Might be because it is an on demand chain and no transactions have gone through

[13-Apr-19 06:06 AM] Strob#3417
For the NA region I just checked and only 8 candidates so far have care to participate to the testNet! So I hope we'll all be elected! 😉

[13-Apr-19 06:07 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Maybe because people have already been an NN and don't need to prove they can do it ?

[13-Apr-19 06:08 AM] Strob#3417
Yes you're right. Or they are rich enough to vote for themselves and win!
