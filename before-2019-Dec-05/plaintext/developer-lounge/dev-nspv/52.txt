I added a neater address book for that GUI (was just displaying Python dictionary, now it is a table), you can click a contact in the address book and it prefills the "send to address" field. It also has multiple themes you can change on the fly and it will save your theme so you don't have to keep changing it on start up.

Fixed the bandwidth issue with this pull request. 
Should be able to make verified txns off chain tip now I think. Although I would need to implement it.

fix bandwidth for sync of chain tip by blackjok3rtt · Pull Reques...
Changes rpc of getpeerinfo to show the last validated header height rather than is_synced.

Not quite right still. 😦 Still wokring on it.

[26-Aug-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r thanks!
i noticed you got rid of the bestknownheight field, but for the html display it is needed. i also made a NSPV_longestchain global to use, but i am not sure if i am setting it correctly. it also seems that the last_validated_header is very rarely set

[26-Aug-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, it does seem it is better, but still not quite right.

[26-Aug-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I didnt get rid of it, it just was not updating for me, so i removed it form RPC. Np to put back

[26-Aug-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i set the bestknownheight to just the highest reported height

[26-Aug-19 07:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes still not right. I have a new version in testing right now

[26-Aug-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and using the last_validated_header as the in sync version

[26-Aug-19 07:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It seems also that some nodes that show as conencted do not respond... And never seemt o update anything...

[26-Aug-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it also seems that there is no need to get all headers from a node, if we know the latest validated header from any node, then couldnt we just request that header from another node and if it returns the same, then assume the earlier ones are ok?

[26-Aug-19 07:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes. this is how its working

[26-Aug-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It fetches quickly until it has all the headers that link back to the last notarization.

[26-Aug-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
then slows down to 1 node at a time.

[26-Aug-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, bandwidth is indeed much reduced

[26-Aug-19 07:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, but my code is buggy still./ Hopefulyl wont take too much longer :abusedsmily:

[26-Aug-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven it seems that after a while some fullnodes go non-responsive. can you stress test a node to see if you can reliably reproduce this state on a small chain like ILN

[26-Aug-19 08:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
`https://github.com/jl777/libnspv/pull/113/files` 
This is better. I find that it eventually only gets data from node 1 after while.. Other nodes are being sent requests, but do not respond. Have a few ideas, to mess with later on.

[26-Aug-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r it is strange that it isnt talking to more than a few nodes... before these changes, it was talking to all of them

[26-Aug-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i also see cases where bestknownheight is less than the "in sync" height, which seems a bit strange and not sure how that could happen

[26-Aug-19 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#3181
To slow it down, I had to slow it down... This means that it is no longer, polling every peer for the same block height every time.

[26-Aug-19 09:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Once it has enough headers to match back to chain tip, the last height it saw from each node that is a valid header (links back to last notarization) is saved.. Maybe we need to speed it up a little more, Although they all do eventually end up quite close. 
My bestknownheight is still gettting stuck.. 
```{
    "nodeid": 6,
    "protocolversion": 3,
    "ipaddress": "136.243.58.134",
    "port": 7770,
    "lastping": 1566811951,
    "time_started_con": 1566809171,
    "time_last_request": 1566811978,
    "services": 1879048197,
    "missbehavescore": 0,
    "bestknownheight": 1503652,
    "last_validated_header": 1503714
  }
```
This is why I commented it out earlier.

[26-Aug-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
ALso I have left my KMD nSPV ndoe running a while and ti is now talking to all peers. Will do some investigation on this see what I can work out.

[26-Aug-19 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems an  intermittent  problem

[26-Aug-19 09:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven feel free to consult me on stress test matter - there is ready scripts for spam

[26-Aug-19 09:43 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think there needs to be some way to detect if a node has responded to a request. This will make things much easier.

[26-Aug-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Currently it must loop from notarization height  forwards to chain tip, but if a node does not respond, it must go back and fetch this header from another node. This seems to at times take many attempts.

[26-Aug-19 09:44 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The new logic that checks block heights are cached, helps a lot but its still doing undefined weird things.

[26-Aug-19 09:46 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Also by slowing things down like this, it may lose some of its reorg handling.... Not too sure, need to test that.

[26-Aug-19 09:51 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@jl777c @TonyL Got it. Full node I've set for tests works fine for pretty much a week now, it might be a problem with libnspv stopping connection to the full node.
Well, just a few thoughts.

[26-Aug-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@blackjok3r maybe just have all incoming packets update a last responded timestamp, then you can check that to see how active a node is. it feels like you are pruning away most of the nodes and only talking to one. maybe a bit of randomization in node selection?

[26-Aug-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
The timer is set for each node.

[26-Aug-19 09:53 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I think I know whats going on, just have to mess with it longer

[26-Aug-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
on the plus side, the bandwidth used is way down!

[26-Aug-19 09:54 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes maybe too much lol.

[26-Aug-19 09:55 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am not actualky bannign any nodes so far, but I do want to try to make it try to find new peers, when one is not responding.

[26-Aug-19 09:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
If the lastvalidated height has not updated in a long time, I can try to force requests to that node, then if it fails to respond, drop it and try to add a new one.. 
Also may make th ban clear after some time, so it doesnt end up banning too many nodes permenantly.

[26-Aug-19 09:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Seems to me that getting a reliable set of peers will solve most of the edge case bugs.

[26-Aug-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all the active nodes were responding using the old bruteforce method

[26-Aug-19 10:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes, they are rsp[onding for me now also.... its only sometimes... maybe its something i changed not sure.. Will try to sort it.

[26-Aug-19 10:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Before the way it worked, was to poll every node for the same block height at the same time...
I have changed it so each nodes counter/timer is seperate with a random delay... so it only polls one at  a time.

[26-Aug-19 10:04 AM] blackjok3r#3181
This is used by the libbtc code, but was disabled for ours... Maybe the 2 are not playing nicely together and I need to rethink how to do it.

[26-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok. it does seem the issue is algorithmic and not networking related

[26-Aug-19 10:18 AM] blackjok3r#3181
yes agree

[26-Aug-19 10:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Might have found it... Just a matter of tuning the delay now so that it does not go so fast.

[26-Aug-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv html wallet is now localizable into different languages. we just need a file in the same format at ~/libnspv/html/languages/english.json
we need at least the following languages: french, italian, chinese, chinese simplified, japanese, korean, russian and spanish.
those are the languages with seed words. however, the html can support basically any language, just need the language.json file

The NSPV_longestchain, should that just be the highest height, or a validated height? That links back?

[26-Aug-19 01:20 PM] blackjok3r#3181
not sure it matters, as it also has validated header

[26-Aug-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
validated is probably better
