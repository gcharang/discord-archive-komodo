To change the TX size you need to start a new container. The miner node keeps all the blockchain data.

[31-May-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It would basically be 1 test with 1 payment. and one test with 100. They are totally seperate things.

[31-May-18 08:33 AM] blackjok3r#0000
they would actually even be totally seperate chains.

[31-May-18 08:34 AM] smk762#0000
yeah apis connected is superflous with AWS db. Can derive active chains from there which is a better metric showing pretty much the same anyways.

Its pretty slow inside virtualbox and docker on laptop. Pretty much ready to push this onto a server.

[31-May-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
But I need to know what to do with that JSON. 🙂

[31-May-18 08:37 AM] smk762#0000
got a url for the json for me to tap in to?

[31-May-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It just pushes it to a text file on a shared volume right now.

[31-May-18 08:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
@Mylo

[31-May-18 08:38 AM] imylomylo#0000
ok i'll modify REST - won't be long

[31-May-18 08:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Building the docker images on a 2 core vultr should be fast enough to saturate mempool.

[31-May-18 09:00 AM] blackjok3r#0000
single chain

[31-May-18 09:19 AM] imylomylo#0000
put this in `config.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash
BLOCKNOTIFYURL="https://njeitldkqc.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v0/blocknotify"
```
put your JSON as `${RESULT}` for this script
and put this as `blocknotify` script in your AC.conf
```
#!/bin/bash
source config.sh
curl \
--verbose \
--request OPTIONS \
${BLOCKNOTIFYURL} \
--header 'Origin: http://localhost:8000' \
--header 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: Origin, Accept, Content-Type' \
--header 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST'
sleep 2
curl \
--verbose \
--header "Origin: http://localhost:8000" \
--request POST \
--data "${RESULT}" \
${BLOCKNOTIFYURL}

```

[31-May-18 09:19 AM] imylomylo#0000
blackjok3r ☝

[31-May-18 09:20 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am already using blocknotify so this will just have to go into that script I guess.

[31-May-18 09:21 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I got in trouble for using a heap of `source` lol.. so I will pass that URL as a docker ENV var 🙂

[31-May-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
can I do that?

[31-May-18 09:22 AM] imylomylo#0000
yeah no probs with that.

[31-May-18 09:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
cool. That way we can change it without rebuilding image. I put nearly everything as ENV var. Pretty pleased how it turned out. 😄

[31-May-18 09:23 AM] imylomylo#0000
because of CORS enabled (which i can disable) you have to send an OPTIONS http method first, if it causes a problem, i can disable CORS and we can just try POST.
having CORS enabled will allow us to lockdown from which hosts can send data into the REST service, in case some dickheads want to inject stuff 🙂

[31-May-18 09:30 AM] imylomylo#0000
currently set up that URL for 1 tx / s of writes.  if you're going to fire up 60 ACs, I'll probably have to increase the DB throughput. lmk how many chains.  if you're doing 60, 10 writes/s should be fine ... _shrug_

[31-May-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
just waiting on the image to build. Takes a little while.

[31-May-18 09:30 AM] imylomylo#0000
no probs mate

[31-May-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Just using 1 chain

[31-May-18 09:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We havent generated the docker-compose

[31-May-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its just 1 manul chain for now

[31-May-18 09:31 AM] imylomylo#0000
ok, what's the plan for this evening?

[31-May-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
until we have it working 100% perfectly.

[31-May-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I guess run a blast and see if smk762 can get the required data?

[31-May-18 09:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
once we have 1 chain wokring, then its just a matter of scaling up a few at a time to see how it all reacts.

[31-May-18 09:32 AM] imylomylo#0000
💦

[31-May-18 09:32 AM] smk762#0000
I'll need to mod my code a bit, and a link to the json. Will see how far I can get tonight, but woot! long weekend starts in 24hrs 🎉

[31-May-18 09:34 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Timed it well then. Its been a bit of a battle on my side with docker, but patchkez was a great help as always.

[31-May-18 09:35 AM] imylomylo#0000
`https://njeitldkqc.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v0/blocknotify` that's your URL smk762

[31-May-18 09:35 AM] smk762#0000
thanks!

[31-May-18 09:35 AM] imylomylo#0000
that will return ALL the stuff blackjok3r sends into it.

[31-May-18 09:37 AM] imylomylo#0000
if you want specific records, needs some work 😬 
you will receive what blackjok3r sends in with additional JSON attributes `createdAt` `updatedAt` and `id`

[31-May-18 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the blast can actually run indefinitely so if we have enough data it can just keep going until it spends all 77 million coins LOL

[31-May-18 09:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am doing this test with 1payment TX

[31-May-18 09:37 AM] pondsea#0000
My understanding was that any action was a transaction? So a payment = a transaction

[31-May-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
no

[31-May-18 09:38 AM] pondsea#0000
I guess im mistaken?

[31-May-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
payment is payment. I knew this would be a problem, but the last test failed before the 1 payment TX test could be run.

[31-May-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We got avout 20,000TX/s

[31-May-18 09:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
verified

[31-May-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Still have all the blockchains and there are explorers up at 88.99.57.78:7128

[31-May-18 09:39 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Increase the port number by 2, for the next chain.

[31-May-18 09:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
@Mylo is it working?

[31-May-18 09:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
nothing there yet

[31-May-18 09:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
checking logs

[31-May-18 09:47 AM] gcharang#0000
In a single blockchain transaction, we can do a traditional payment to many people.

[31-May-18 09:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I have JSON being output from the stats script, I just added the code you gave me to that.

[31-May-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I cant really check logs as marketmaker floods thousands of lines.

[31-May-18 09:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and its in the same place.

[31-May-18 09:48 AM] imylomylo#0000
yeah no probs, i'm c+p your sample json

[31-May-18 09:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think its safe to say we will need 2 TxBlaster containers to saturate at 1 payment TX. Its still not full even on a straight VPS.

[31-May-18 09:49 AM] imylomylo#0000
you have to escape your quote marks
e.g.
```
RESULT="{ \"size\": 696770, \"height\": 10, \"time\": 1527755479, \"totaltx\": \"3084\", \"ac\": \"TXSCL220\" }"

```

[31-May-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ahh ok.

[31-May-18 09:50 AM] imylomylo#0000
https://njeitldkqc.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v0/blocknotify

[31-May-18 09:50 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I will stop it now and change wont be long.

[31-May-18 09:50 AM] imylomylo#0000
there's the sample ☝

[31-May-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
need to take a break for 30mins

[31-May-18 09:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
bak soon

[31-May-18 09:58 AM] pondsea#0000
Can you point me to some doc showing why a payment isnt a tx?

[31-May-18 09:59 AM] imylomylo#0000
cos in a tx you can have multiple payments.

[31-May-18 09:59 AM] pondsea#0000
Ah and you were doing 100x right?

[31-May-18 09:59 AM] imylomylo#0000
we were doing both 1 payment per 1 tx, and another 100 payments per 1 tx.

[31-May-18 09:59 AM] imylomylo#0000
separate tests.

[31-May-18 10:00 AM] pondsea#0000
Ok i will wait till you do the 1tx test then i will shit on that sys devs face

[31-May-18 10:00 AM] imylomylo#0000
i used to call that act "dehumanizing someone" - but i'm a saint now 😇

[31-May-18 10:01 AM] pondsea#0000
800,000/100=8ktps

[31-May-18 10:01 AM] pondsea#0000
still shits on any other currency

[31-May-18 10:03 AM] pondsea#0000
"how about you give the number of signature verifications per second instead which is the real benchmark."

[31-May-18 10:04 AM] smk762#0000
only difference between a payment and a tx is the number of senders being 1:many instead of 1:1

[31-May-18 10:04 AM] smk762#0000
it's a pretty pissweak limitation that would constrain realworl use cases beyond reasonable limits

[31-May-18 10:05 AM] imylomylo#0000
two separate tests, the 100 payments were done at 2pm, the 1 payments were done at 3pm.
we'll get better documentation of the event next time
and keep a journal,
Dear Diary,
:trollface:

[31-May-18 10:07 AM] jl777#0000
we can get 10x the tx/sec using small 1 payment tx, but it loses 10x the payments

[31-May-18 10:16 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Generating enough 1 payment TX to fill mempool is proving harder than larger ones. But we can just spawn more TxBlaster nodes. Its literally no diffrence to start 2 or a million containers. Limited by the cloud power we can get only.

[31-May-18 10:28 AM] manfromaus#0000
Is there an eta at current on the next test?

[31-May-18 10:28 AM] manfromaus#0000
Or just working towards the goal for the moment with unknown timeframe

[31-May-18 10:36 AM] shossain#0000

[31-May-18 10:43 AM] jl777#0000
does getinfo show the notarization hashes/etc properly?

[31-May-18 10:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
@Mylo I used jq to build the JSON, I cant work out how to automatically "stringify" it (is that what you call it lol?)

[31-May-18 10:43 AM] jl777#0000
if so, then it will be up to @libscott to get the MoMoM validated

[31-May-18 10:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
ummmm don't worry.  what are you asking?

[31-May-18 10:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
it's cool either way, if something needs to change, i can massage your data into DB anyways 😛

[31-May-18 10:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The JSON being pushed from blocknotify you said it needs the '\' added, but 'jq' built it its not made with bash so I cant just manually add all the '\'

[31-May-18 10:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
oh..... can you do a sed on it within your script to e.g. `s/\"/\\\"/` or somethign like that

[31-May-18 10:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
