[13-Mar-19 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c is there a CLI method for seeing the exact reward for a spent output?

[13-Mar-19 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
`komodod gettxout` works great but it only works on unspent outputs

[13-Mar-19 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it's hard to reproduce in a test suite because the value is constantly changing

[13-Mar-19 06:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
would be great if I there was a way I could reference a spent output to `komodod` and it would give me the reward value when it was spent

[13-Mar-19 06:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
that way it's reproducible and much easier to test against

[13-Mar-19 06:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
any way to do this?

[13-Mar-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
no easy way

[13-Mar-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
would have to do it on an entire block basis based on the txfees, and if it doesnt match, wont know which tx is mismatched

[13-Mar-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it requires processing a block to know the exact value

[13-Mar-19 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok

[13-Mar-19 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
no worries

[13-Mar-19 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've added manual unit tests for every single consensus rule

[13-Mar-19 07:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
and also randomly picked a few unspent UTXOs with `komodod gettxout` to test against to try and catch any anomalies

[13-Mar-19 07:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
that should be more than enough

[13-Mar-19 07:14 AM] lukechilds#2707

👍 👌 

[13-Mar-19 07:18 PM] Strob#3417
Just used your app successfully the other day 😉

[13-Mar-19 07:19 PM] Strob#3417
It's just a bit stressful to use cause there's always a risk for a phishing website to empty our wallet though...

[13-Mar-19 07:21 PM] Strob#3417
@lukechilds

[13-Mar-19 07:39 PM] Alright#0419
@Strob it's safe as long as you're diligent when the ledger device asks you to confirm the outputs

[13-Mar-19 07:42 PM] Strob#3417
We must also be diligent when we accessing the webpage to make sure the address is well typed and not using special characters to confuse the user. Also there may be risks of the website itself or address being hacked...

[13-Mar-19 07:44 PM] Strob#3417
Example replace the b with ƅ

[13-Mar-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
If the website itself is hacked, they still cannot steal funds unless you let them

[13-Mar-19 07:44 PM] Alright#0419
by confirming the transaction on the physical device

[13-Mar-19 07:45 PM] Alright#0419
it's very very important that you triple check it when it does ask you to confirm

[13-Mar-19 07:46 PM] Strob#3417
Yes but the legitimate site is asking me to confirm sending my whole wallet content to a new adddress. how can I be sure that this new address is on my ledger before confirming the transaction?

[13-Mar-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
Ahh right, I forgot about that aspect. @lukechilds is that the only possible way to do it? I found that a bit scary as well

[13-Mar-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
You are right about that. I had completely forgotten that the coins are sent to a new address

[13-Mar-19 07:51 PM] PTYX#6840
It sends to a new address? i thought it sent back to the original address

[13-Mar-19 07:52 PM] PTYX#6840
i guess if you have multiple utxos though, the original address could be more than one

[13-Mar-19 07:53 PM] Strob#3417
yes in my case I had mutliple addresses and everything was sent to a single address that is different from all my previous ones

[13-Mar-19 09:03 PM] PTYX#6840
yeah maybe that can be changed to use the same address to avoid confusion

[14-Mar-19 01:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
It sends to a new address? i thought it sent back to the original address
```

Yeah, we send to the next unused derivation path as per the BIP44 standard. Address re-use is bad for privacy and security. I don't think sending back to the same address is a good idea but I'm open to feedback.

More information here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim#why-do-all-my-funds-get-sent-back-to-a-new-address

And if you disagree with our decision, you can vote here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/issues/3

If enough people disagree with our decision then I'm definitely open to changing it.

```
how can I be sure that this new address is on my ledger before confirming the transaction?
```

One of the steps asks you to confirm the new address on your Ledger. The Ledger can't show arbitrary addresses, only addresses it can derive from it's internal private key. This provides cryptographic proof that the address shown on the device belongs to you.

If you follow all steps properly and compare the data displayed on the Ledger with the data displayed in the web app, it's impossible for a malicious site to steal your funds.

So to clarify, risk with new address is avoided by clarifying the new address on the device in step 2

[14-Mar-19 01:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
However I understand that this makes people feel uncomfortable and they maybe don't realise that confirming the address on the device is cryptographic proof

[14-Mar-19 01:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm a firm believer that if users are complaining about something it's because the app's wrong not the users (even if the users are wrong too haha), so we definitely need to try and make this more clear

[14-Mar-19 01:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
Also, just a consideration, but if we were to change the app to send back to old addresses, that could actually increase the opportunity for phishing attacks. As PTYX mentions, it gets a bit complicated when the account has multiple UTXOs across multiple different addresses.

We can send back to all the same addresses, however now instead of the users having to confirm one address that's been cryptographically derived on the device for them to check against, they have to check many. What if you have 20 addresses? You need to manually check 20 addresses on your Ledger device. It would be much easier for a phishing attack to sneak an incorrect address in here.

There's also the issue that I'm not even sure it's possible to click through 20 outputs on the Ledger without it timing out over the Web API. Which means the user has no choice but to blindly accept or not confirm at all due to timing out.

[14-Mar-19 01:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
One way we could mitigate this is instead of claiming per-account, you claim per address. However that could be very tedious and time consuming if you've a lot of addresses. Considering Ledger Live is a BIP44 wallet so every transaction is +1 address and +1 UTXO

[14-Mar-19 01:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
So yeah, we have considered all options, and I'm confident that what we have now is the easiest, safest and least error prone way of doing it.

[14-Mar-19 01:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
But it is kind of confusing, hopefully this helps people understand our reasoning

[17-Mar-19 06:43 PM] Strob#3417
@lukechilds Thanks for clarifying! So "The Ledger can't show arbitrary addresses, only addresses it can derive from it's internal private key." I believe you but is there any doc about this on the ledger website?

[17-Mar-19 06:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not aware that they specifically state this anywhere but you can see how the API is used in the docs:

http://ledgerhq.github.io/ledgerjs/docs/

search for "getWalletPublicKey(path, verify, segwit)" and open that section up, you'll see the first argument is a BIP32 derivation path. There's no API method to pass in an arbitrary address to display. You can only pass a derivation path that will be derived on the device and then the resulting address will be displayed.

[01-Apr-19 06:44 PM] Senda#7983
Hi @lukechilds I'm trying to claim the rewards and I get the following error: Error
Ledger device: Internal error, please report (0x6f00)

[01-Apr-19 06:50 PM] Senda#7983
This happens after this step: 
Approve the transaction on your device after carefully checking the values and addresses match those shown above.

[01-Apr-19 06:51 PM] Senda#7983
After i have confirmed three times on my device

[02-Apr-19 12:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
Hi @Senda

[02-Apr-19 12:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
This is a known issue, it's caused by Chrome changing the way they communicate with U2F devices which is how it communicates with the Ledger

[02-Apr-19 12:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
Ledger are aware of the issue and will release new apps for the Ledger to resolve this

[02-Apr-19 12:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
for now, if you use Opera instead of Chrome, that should resolve the issue

[02-Apr-19 05:04 AM] Senda#7983
Thanks @lukechilds 👌

[02-Apr-19 08:01 AM] gcharang#6833

can you explain how you arrived at `const DEVISOR = 10512000;` in the rewards-calc module:

[02-Apr-19 08:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
lukechilds
thanks for you answers
also, re the devisor
I'm still not quite sure what exactly this is
when you get a value and devide it by a deviser it gives you the interest per minute, right?
so you can multiply that up for the duration of minutes to find the total interest amount
how did you actually calculate the value 10512000?
would just like to make the meaning a bit more clear in my code so I understand it when I come back to it

jl777c
it does all the multiplying and dividing needed to end up at 5% APR
i just combined numerator and denominator constants into a single one, but this way it avoids any overflow/underflow issues
in essence it is a constant. if you use half its value, then it will be 10% APR
if you use double the value 2.5% APR
it is just the constant that calculates 5% APR when used in the equation where it is
365 * 24 * 60 / 10512000 = 0.05
it is the divisor to use on the minutes in a year to get 5%
```

[02-Apr-19 08:15 AM] gcharang#6833
hah! thanks for the reply, it's a bit more clear now!

[07-Apr-19 06:03 AM] klein#5233
Hi  @lukechilds  would it be possible to have an "option" to claim rewards back to  your current address,  instead of changing the whole thing completely. Give people an option to choose if they want to to use change addresses or not

[08-Apr-19 10:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah that's definitely possible

[08-Apr-19 10:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
Although it still suffers from all the same issues listed above

[08-Apr-19 10:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
and is more complex to support two options simultaneously than it is to support either option alone

Announcement, the Atomic Labs Ledger reward claim app is now free to use 🎉

In light of recent events we want to encourage more secure asset storage, so hopefully this can convince a few more people to move over to hardware wallets, and give the users who are now moving over an easy way to claim.

It’s totally free, we take no cut, try it out: https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

You have @hyperDEX  (Pondsea) mainly to thank for this. He funded me to develop it out of his own pocket and was hoping to make his money back with the fees. He’s nowhere near breaking even but has decided to remove the fees for the benefit of the community.

For all the paranoid people out there, use the ledger app to see what the next address will be, then use the claim app, verify it is the same, then verify when you doing the claim the address is yet again the same on the ledger as the one on screen then send it

[09-Jul-19 10:03 PM] KevinS#0577
hey all, we are currently building the new main komodo site which will include a rewards calculator. my understanding is that the rewards rate is annual 0.05116 rate paid out on a monthly basis. i just want to make sure i have my formula correct:

K * (1+0.05116/12) ^ M

where K = # of Komodo you start with and M = # of months you are projecting

[09-Jul-19 10:04 PM] KevinS#0577
i'm looking at this page and it doesn't seem to be correct: https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards-calc
all this page is doing is K * (1 + 0.05116/12 * M) which neglects your compounding rewards
