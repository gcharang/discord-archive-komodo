`I own nothing of hivemind. I built the Amoveo blockchain.`
OK, so to be clear:
You issue is that Komodo's definition of how an "oracle" acts and aggregates data differs from the one you decided for your chain and therefore it's a "false advertisement" "scam";  am I following along correctly?

[22-Mar-19 04:55 PM] zack#6467
we agree on the definition of oracle

[22-Mar-19 04:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if we were claiming trustless oracles, i could see his point

[22-Mar-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
but using the definition that oracle is something that gets offchain data onchain, that is what oracles CC does

it isnt trustlessoracles

[22-Mar-19 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
a layer to extract a trustless data stream would need to be created, maybe that could be called trustless CC

[22-Mar-19 04:57 PM] zack#6467
everything on a blockchain is trustless by default. 
Because it doesn't make sense to use a blockchain if you are going to use trust anyway.

[22-Mar-19 04:57 PM] zack#6467
Blockchain is expensive, and the only advantage it gives is trustlessness.

[22-Mar-19 04:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but how do you extract data from real world without trust in the data production?

Blockchain Oracles Explained - Mycryptopedia
blockchain oracles are a third-party information source that have the sole function of supplying data to blockchains.

Blockchain oracles are the key to getting information from the outside world. The only possibility is to employ trusted off-chain software.

[22-Mar-19 04:58 PM] zack#6467
you could use a trusted-feed as one source of data, like jl777c suggests.
or you could do commit-reveal mechanisms like bitocin hivemind.
or you could have a betting mechanism like Amoveo.

[22-Mar-19 04:58 PM] zack#6467
none of those mechanisms are called "oracles". they are just one tool to help build an oracle

[22-Mar-19 04:58 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So we agree there is more than one way to skin a cat.   At the end of the day it's still a cat.

[22-Mar-19 04:58 PM] jl777c#5810
industry definition of oracle does not assume trustlessness

[22-Mar-19 04:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Long hair Short Hair Hairless.   All cats, but of differeing origin / purpose.

[22-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
based on all the google search results for blockchain oracle. it is the one exception to the assumption of being trustless

[22-Mar-19 04:59 PM] jl777c#5810
that is my interpretation of the definition for oracles

[22-Mar-19 04:59 PM] MyName#0491
`Blockchain is expensive`
That's quite subjective and not wholly accurate (some would say "false advertising")

[22-Mar-19 05:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but those mechanisms  just make a data stream to be assumed as a quality data stream because a majority voted or whatever... it doesnt meant there is complete trustlessness

[22-Mar-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i am interested in making a trustless layer on top, but you dont say what changes are needed

[22-Mar-19 05:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@MyName  agree

[22-Mar-19 05:00 PM] zack#6467
If I said I have "smartcontracts on my blockchain", but really you just send the contract to Bob, and he signs over the result onto the blockchain.
Would you say that advertising this way is honest? @jl777c

[22-Mar-19 05:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i mention correlation to majority, do you say that is no good?

[22-Mar-19 05:01 PM] zack#6467
smartcontracts aren't necessarily trustless, but if you talk about smart contracts on a blockchain, it is trustless by default.
Because there is no reason to use a blockchain for something that isn't trustless.

[22-Mar-19 05:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That’s not true

[22-Mar-19 05:01 PM] jl777c#5810
do a google search of oracles, so far none of them assume trustlessness as a property of oracles

[22-Mar-19 05:02 PM] zack#6467
all the search results are for that company that makes Java.

{Reactions}
🤦 (2) 

[22-Mar-19 05:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so is using correlation to majority a valid way to get trustless data out of raw data sources?

[22-Mar-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
that seemed to be what vitalik recommended

[22-Mar-19 05:03 PM] zack#6467
it is a bad strategy, because you need to lock up much more value into the votecoins vs how much money can be used for betting at one time

[22-Mar-19 05:03 PM] jl777c#5810
most of the articles are saying you need to trust your oracle, that is sort of why its called an oracle

[22-Mar-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
what betting? there is no betting in most all the usecases for oracles CC

[22-Mar-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
one dapp is posting GPS data of where his dog is

[22-Mar-19 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
getting that offchain data onchain

[22-Mar-19 05:04 PM] zack#6467
Just because someone write some article doesn't justify advertising yourself as an oracle comparable to augur or bitocin hivemind or Amoveo.

[22-Mar-19 05:05 PM] MyName#0491
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator should be involved in this conversation

[22-Mar-19 05:08 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
a CC oracle is a persistent, decentralised, immutable data record

[22-Mar-19 05:08 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just because you come here saying that the only exclusive way to use oracle word is in a trustless oracle doesnt make you right.

[22-Mar-19 05:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
the validity of data at time of write is potentially inaccurate

[22-Mar-19 05:09 PM] zack#6467
Sorry for trying to help.
Ultimately it is only Komodo's reputation that is at stake here.

[22-Mar-19 05:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
so there is trust required from original source

[22-Mar-19 05:09 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
but once on chain, it is what it is and will stay that way

[22-Mar-19 05:10 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i dont think komodo's reputation is at stake just because you say oracles are only trusless oracles.

[22-Mar-19 05:10 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Ive put a lot of thought into mitgation of GPS spoofing attempts

[22-Mar-19 05:11 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
same applies for scientific survey data

[22-Mar-19 05:11 PM] zack#6467
investors are getting wise to the wordplay. The are noticing when you try to make trusted applications as if they are secure.

[22-Mar-19 05:11 PM] MyName#0491
`Ultimately it is only Komodo's reputation that is at stake here.`
@zack The only "reputation" issue seems, to me as one not really well versed in the topic, that you take exception with Komodo not doing things your way, despite the fact that you've repeatedly ignored the lead dev's requests for you to lay out the "right way"

[22-Mar-19 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Oracle storying data - oracle feed recording data from datapoint into the oracle
You can create whathewher feed you want on top of CC

[22-Mar-19 05:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
sure you can fudge the stas before it hits the oracle, but you cant change it. proper review will expose fraudulent entries.

[22-Mar-19 05:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Publisher pubkey is immutable - so it's easy to make reputation system based on it

[22-Mar-19 05:12 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
Trust the chain, verify the source

[22-Mar-19 05:13 PM] TonyL#3577
If needed you can combine in your dapp data from few oracles / few publishers which providing datasets for same events

[22-Mar-19 05:13 PM] zack#6467
Komodo is claiming to have a way to get data onto the blockchain, without making it clear that it is a trusted source of data, and there is no reason to use the blockchain for any application using the data.
These kinds of misleading claims can hurt your reputation.

[22-Mar-19 05:13 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
`no reason`? sounds like an extreme position

[22-Mar-19 05:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
it's valid for provenance

[22-Mar-19 05:14 PM] zack#6467
Why would you use a blockchain, if it is a trusted application?
Blockchain is expensive, and it's only  purpose is to overcome trust.

[22-Mar-19 05:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Wrong

[22-Mar-19 05:14 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
immuntibilty has value

[22-Mar-19 05:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Interoperability , Security

[22-Mar-19 05:15 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
and it costs me nearly nothing to run the couple of hundred oracles I've setup

[22-Mar-19 05:15 PM] zack#6467
so if bitcoin was trusted, but immutable, you would still want to use it?
Your money can get stolen, and it is impossible to to undo the theft due to immutability

`Blockchain is expensive`
you keep regurgitating that, but I have a $15 HDD that contains over 40,000 chains (including bitcoin) that factually shows otherwise

[22-Mar-19 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo assetchains are not expensive

[22-Mar-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
expected datafees are like micropayments

[22-Mar-19 05:16 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'm running on an assetchain with no CMC price, didnt ICO, am not selling. The only cost is VPS, and it doesn't take much

[22-Mar-19 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it pays for server hosting

[22-Mar-19 05:16 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
in the betting example that you bring up... you collect data from the results of a sports event, then based on results you execute transactions on chain... why do you need all the trustless data thing when the data needed is known to all ?

[22-Mar-19 05:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
I'd avoid single source immediate payment of wagers

[22-Mar-19 05:17 PM] zack#6467
The $5 a month I spend maintaining my full node isn't even 0.1% of the value invested into creating Amoveo.

I might agree with, though

[22-Mar-19 05:17 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
that applies beyond blockchain

[22-Mar-19 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
with amoveo you say that the user should follow the fork that has the oracle result they agree with

[22-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
this seems fine if there is just one active oracle

[22-Mar-19 05:18 PM] zack#6467
the expectation is that the true version of history will have more valuable coins

[22-Mar-19 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens if there are many and there is no fork that you agree with completely?

[22-Mar-19 05:18 PM] zack#6467
if you go far enough back in history, there must be a point in time where you agreed with all of the oracle results

[22-Mar-19 05:18 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
oracles become politicians

[22-Mar-19 05:18 PM] MyName#0491
`The $5 a month I spend maintaining my full node isn't even 0.1% of the value invested into creating Amoveo.`
The number of things conflated and misrepresented in that sentence is mind-boggling

[22-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if you go back to genesis you would agree with all of them as there are no Toracles yet

[22-Mar-19 05:19 PM] zack#6467
yes

[22-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but at this moment there are two oracles, both of which you disagree with the mainchain

[22-Mar-19 05:19 PM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
noone had opinions in the garden of Eden

[22-Mar-19 05:19 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there arent 4 forks

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] zack#6467
you can build a new block on top of any existing block

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so the user has to become a miner?

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
what sort of hashrate is needed? how practical is that?

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] zack#6467
what?

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] zack#6467
why would they have to mine?

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
"you can build a new block on top of any existing block"

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] zack#6467
right

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
that sounded like mining

[22-Mar-19 05:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt?

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] zack#6467
yes, miners can build on top of any existing block

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is mining, i assume PoW, which means hashrate

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] MyName#0491
`so the user has to become a miner?
what sort of hashrate is needed? how practical is that?`
Dr Craig says that it's not only practical, but factually true

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] zack#6467
so for example, if you are on block N, and I make 3 invalid blocks for N+1, you wouldn't sync any of the invalid blocks, you would stay on block N.

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] PTYX#6840
It seems like his issue is semantics and not with what the Komodo CC Oracle does

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] zack#6467
The typical user in Amoveo isn't running a full node or syncing blocks anyway

[22-Mar-19 05:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so if a user disagrees with the mainchain and cant find a fork with both oracles in the state he agrees with, he just waits?
