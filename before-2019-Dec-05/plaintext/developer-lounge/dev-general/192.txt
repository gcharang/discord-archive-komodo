I use a dummy assetchain daemon to do it

[30-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
`./komodod -ac_name=anything -ac_supply=1` wait for it to load, import key, sign tx, stop it, delete datadir

[30-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
is what I normally do

[30-Jun-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
you need to provide script of inputs if the node is unaware of them

[30-Jun-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
to sign the transaction, more data is needed after sapling

if the data is available in the wallet, it seems to get it automatic. if not, it needs to be provided, because it is needed to sign the tx

@Alright & @Deleted User @gcharang   is there any documentation for a newb to understand the transaction signing.  how to do it and what it involves & why to do it?

[01-Jul-19 03:53 AM] Mylo#8306
idk what you're exactly trying to do, but can only vaguely describe it.   also i don't have the scripts to do it quickly anyway - would be cool if this could be available to all users so they can look after themselves.

Am trying to convert compressed WIF to uncompressed WIF. Could someone point me to a general explanation of the math behind this? Can't find any good resources

[01-Jul-19 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there is some way to calculate the other half from the compressed wif, google should find it

[01-Jul-19 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
```
“Uncompressed” WIF private key:

0x80 + 32 byte raw private key + 4 byte checksum

“Compressed” WIF private key:

0x80 + 32 byte raw private key + 0x01 + 4 byte checksum
```
found this from searching, but I can't seem to get it to work as described

[01-Jul-19 08:33 PM] Alright#0419
does that seem correct?

[01-Jul-19 08:34 PM] Alright#0419
don't have a problem getting raw private key, just not sure how to proceed from there

[01-Jul-19 08:34 PM] jl777c#5810
uncompressed is 64 bytes

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, the wif

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the pubkey that is 32 vs 64

[01-Jul-19 08:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is a 0x01 added for compressed

[01-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
```
def WIFconv(byte, WIF):
    first_encode = base58.b58decode(private_key_WIF)
    private_key_full = binascii.hexlify(first_encode)
    private_key = private_key_full[2:-8]
    raw_privkey = private_key.decode("utf-8")
    extended_key = byte+raw_privkey
    first_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(extended_key)).hexdigest()
    second_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(first_sha256)).hexdigest()
    # add checksum to end of extended key
    final_key = extended_key+second_sha256[:8]
    # Wallet Import Format = base 58 encoded final_key
    WIF = base58.b58encode(binascii.unhexlify(final_key))
    return(WIF.decode("utf-8"))
```
this works fine for converting between prefixes, but I'm trying to rework it to convert compressed to uncompressed. Based on what that says, I assumed this would work, but it doesn't
```
def WIFconv(byte, WIF):
    first_encode = base58.b58decode(private_key_WIF)
    private_key_full = binascii.hexlify(first_encode)
    private_key = private_key_full[2:-8]
    raw_privkey = private_key.decode("utf-8")
    extended_key = byte+raw_privkey+'01'
    first_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(extended_key)).hexdigest()
    second_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(first_sha256)).hexdigest()
    # add checksum to end of extended key
    final_key = extended_key+second_sha256[:8]
    # Wallet Import Format = base 58 encoded final_key
    WIF = base58.b58encode(binascii.unhexlify(final_key))
    return(WIF.decode("utf-8"))
```

[01-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Alright#0419
`    extended_key = byte+raw_privkey` vs `    extended_key = byte+raw_privkey+'01'`

[01-Jul-19 08:41 PM] Alright#0419
I've tried it before and after sha steps, wasn't sure if it was meant to be part of the checksum or not, neither seems to work

[01-Jul-19 08:41 PM] jl777c#5810
iguana has code that generates wif from privkey

[01-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Alright#0419

$HUSH is now the most bandwidth-efficient Zcash protocol coin!
We just removed the need to download another large Sprout-related file. Now only 50MB of setup files are needed where $ZEC + all other coins require 1.6GB to be downloaded before ever syncing!

the above patch could be ported to KMD as well

[05-Jul-19 06:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
since no AC's have groth16 joinsplits, but some KMD ac's do have old-style sprout joinsplits so getting rid of that file is not as easy

[05-Jul-19 06:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
still, 700MB savings is good

@Deleted User does OOT have groth16 joinsplits?

[06-Jul-19 03:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is the only AC I know that didn't do sapling with everybody else

[06-Jul-19 03:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
but I don't think James enabled/allowed anybody to use groth16, maybe I am wrong

[06-Jul-19 03:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
Using groth16 is really dumb

[06-Jul-19 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#3181
So the sprout params are still needed but there is a new sprout param taht was introduced with sapling that we never used, and thats the one you remved right?

[06-Jul-19 03:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
Correct

[06-Jul-19 03:41 AM] blackjok3r#3181
understood. Nice work 😃

[06-Jul-19 03:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is an old sprout param (900MB) and new one (groth16, 700MB)

[06-Jul-19 03:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
Pirate needs the old sprout param, but not groth16

[06-Jul-19 03:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
As far as I know, James prevented any AC from using groth16, smartly

[06-Jul-19 03:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have a patch for KMD ready, it needs testing

[06-Jul-19 03:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZEN uses groth16, i don't know of any other coin that does, other than ZEC

supporting 2 completely different codepaths for Sprout, what a horrible plight

[06-Jul-19 03:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZEN also has not fully enabled sapling yet, because of groth16 shenanigans, I believe

no worries, me too 😅

[06-Jul-19 03:58 AM] blackjok3r#3181
In short, CCs just got much bette unless I totally feked it all up. But it seems to be good.

[06-Jul-19 03:59 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Worked out how to make CC contracts that dont need to lookup every tx vin from disk along with other things, this effectivly makes creating the tx about 100x more CPU/IO intesnive than validating it. Which has always bothered me, validation is very slow. Doing lots of CCtx at oncereally slows things down.

[06-Jul-19 04:00 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Hopefully we can get some tests on labs using hundreds if thousands or even millions of utxos in just 1 contract. 😅
