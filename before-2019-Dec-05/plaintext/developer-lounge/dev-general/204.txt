and to clarify "3.74 zpayments per hour, is the average, over the last 30 days"

[17-Aug-19 04:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is way more than ZEC!

I wonder what the stats for ARRR arrrre....

😂 🥁 

[17-Aug-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
that will need some time to finalize this code, and then run on the much larger ARRR chain

[17-Aug-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
this code made me learn more about BTC internals, again. it always scares me when @jl777c says "I haven't touched that part of the code much"

Had no idea why my stats only were since the last startup, but understanding how it serializes the stats to disk and reads them back brought enlightenment

Hi, is the Pirate exemption for notarizations just named after Pirate and available for other all-z chains?  Or Pirate only?

[18-Aug-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE only

[18-Aug-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810

Ok, thanks 👍

[19-Aug-19 05:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi,
Is it normal for a z-sendmany to also send a small amount to a t-address?  (Doesn't seem to be a good thing at all)
I just did a z_send many to an empty wallet and the result was ```{
  "transparent": "0.00005",
  "interest": "0.00",
  "private": "1.0002",
  "total": "1.00025"
}
```

[19-Aug-19 05:12 AM] CrisF#3405
The transparent balance appeared immediately after the send.

[19-Aug-19 05:13 AM] CrisF#3405
I am mining on the receiving chain, but it is a 0 reward chain.

[19-Aug-19 05:17 AM] CrisF#3405
```getreceivedbyaccount ""
0.00000000```

[19-Aug-19 05:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Is there a way to find out where the `0.00005` came from?

[19-Aug-19 05:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Probably from a utxo that was paying the txfee

[19-Aug-19 05:44 AM] Biz#0842
Anyone have any experience with dual keypairs (like in BLUR or *cough* XMR), and what happens if two addresses were to share the same viewkey but not spendkey, or vice versa?

[19-Aug-19 05:44 AM] Biz#0842
Asking for a friend

[19-Aug-19 05:45 AM] Biz#0842
Just kidding, asking for my purposes

[19-Aug-19 05:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Very little ,  what are you concerned with happening?

[19-Aug-19 05:47 AM] Biz#0842
Not sure. Just seems like something that might cause weird effects, like being able to have an address that has multiple viewkeys which converge to a single transactional record, or different addresses being able to spend from each other

[19-Aug-19 05:49 AM] Biz#0842
In BLUR addresses, for example, this would constitute the first or second half of an address being different, but the other half being identical to another address

[19-Aug-19 05:50 AM] Biz#0842
I just generated 64 addresses with the same spendkey, but a single wallet isn’t receiving all of the transactions, and can’t see all of them either. So, technically the spendkey has funds, but the wallet can’t see the transfers it lacks the viewkey to

[19-Aug-19 05:52 AM] Biz#0842
Which seems to mean that any given BLUR or XMR address may in fact be able to spend someone else’s funds (without being able to see these in the wallet)

[19-Aug-19 05:52 AM] Biz#0842
Provided that the spendkeys converge, I mean

[19-Aug-19 05:55 AM] Biz#0842
Note: these 64 addresses all have different viewkeys

[19-Aug-19 05:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seems more of a user issue of bad key management than something intrinsically wrong with the protocol.   Doesn’t seem out of place,  more like a tautology , a user with a spendkey for addresses A B and C can spend from addresses A.B. and C.

[19-Aug-19 06:05 AM] Biz#0842
Wasn’t claiming it’s an issue with the protocol. The issue would be within application of an existing technology, anyway. Asking out of intrigue mostly

[19-Aug-19 06:06 AM] Biz#0842
Monero uses deterministic keypairs, so this wouldn’t happen under normal conditions unless something in the RNG was biased

[19-Aug-19 11:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CrisF just look at the txid on an explorer

[19-Aug-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CrisF also, did you send from a taddr or zaddr ?

[19-Aug-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
Change rules "change", depending on the transaction type

[19-Aug-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
taddr change flows to a new taddr, zaddr change flows back to same zaddr

[19-Aug-19 11:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
t=>(z,t) will leave behind some transparent change, that is probably what you did

[19-Aug-19 11:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
t sending to z, with taddr change

[19-Aug-19 11:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
like @polycryptoblog described, but I guess I wanted to explain more

[19-Aug-19 11:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog in BTC, if half of your privkey just happens to be half my privkey, there is no loss of privacy. But I think @Biz is saying that if something like that happened in XMR, you could view transactions you shouldn't.  The thing is, what are the chances and will it happen before the end of time?

[19-Aug-19 11:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
2^64 is not super big, it might be more likely than XMR devs would like

Excited to report that $HUSH has invented a new "shielded index" (zindex, similar to txindex) that powers data gathering about shielded transactions!
Gives data on counts, rates, percents of fully and partially shielded transactions and payments.

[19-Aug-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c is it true to say "every block cointains exactly 1 coinbase transaction" ? Is this ever not true ?

[19-Aug-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
if true, makes my stats calculations way simpler, for it to take into account mining xtns

[19-Aug-19 01:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
because # of blocks = # of coinbase xtn, and it's simple to subtract out. Otherwise, I must track it

[19-Aug-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
all the stats work, i am fiddling with making `-zindex` work correctly mostly

[19-Aug-19 01:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
and adding small features because I can't help myself, like tracking notarizations as well

Thanks @dukeleto !
I made the chain so no explorer on it.  
It was a t->z transaction with the extra funds being on the receiving side.

I am trying to find out how to make a  **Zero-Knowledge Vote** in Labs.

[19-Aug-19 04:28 PM] CrisF#3405
A vote that is provably made from a set of voters (keys) and made only once, but unkown which voter it came from.

Looks like James gave advice. Do a z2z xtn to avoid making taddr change

@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator @dukeleto 

Gcharang typically handles the rough drafts of new docs and a large part of the technical side of things. 

I am trying to limit my involvement to only editing the voice of the docs. However, I most often wind up merging things together anyway, so if there is blame to be had, it is probably mine. 

Let me know, if something needs to be fixed. Thanks.

@dukeleto while it is possible to allow more than one coinbase per block, as far as i know, nobody has done that yet and there are a LOT of places that assume a single coinbase per block, so implementing this would be a lot of work

[20-Aug-19 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i wouldnt say impossible though, highly improbable of it happening, and hasnt happened yet

[20-Aug-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c sounds good to me. That makes my stats gathering much easier 👍

[20-Aug-19 04:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
dealing with detecting when to reindex or not is turning out to be really annoying

[20-Aug-19 04:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
pretty sure I am fumbling on something I don't fully understand, so down the rabbit hole I go

[20-Aug-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i would just remember if zindex was off before and now it is on, then reindex if that case happens

[20-Aug-19 04:45 PM] jl777c#5810
in other cases it wont be needed to

[20-Aug-19 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
there is some code which bails out, telling the user to reindex, and I see other code which attempts to force a reindex internally depending on certain conditions. I am emulating this code, but I must be doing something silly. In any case, I am learning about new caves in the codebase that I hadn't fallen into before

[20-Aug-19 09:35 PM] dan.#2473
Lets hypothetically say that on a website one's password is not case sensitive and works in any combo of lower and upper case letters. What are your first thoughts?

[20-Aug-19 09:37 PM] dan.#2473
they must be doing something like .toUpper or .toLower... otherwise it seems passwords wouldn't been hashed and stored correctly

ah, thanks. I might need to `clean`

[21-Aug-19 12:50 AM] blackjok3r#3181
unless it was something that just looked similer

[21-Aug-19 12:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
it happens over and over, it's not a race condition. I think i gotta clean this

[21-Aug-19 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
It was on KMD for me... I switched repos wit Rsync and it went crazy on me

[21-Aug-19 12:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
hmm, it could be from a corrupt block index

[21-Aug-19 12:51 AM] blackjok3r#3181
that too...

[21-Aug-19 12:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, it was a corrupt index. rm'ing my datadir made it happy

you dont know what too long is man 😅

[21-Aug-19 12:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
i feel you, it's only because I have been debugging code 22years that it doesn't take as long, usually :abusedsmily:

[21-Aug-19 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
haha.. Depends what it is I guess... Gotta love a challenge tho.

[21-Aug-19 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
my `zindex` code will be able to count notarizations and so it will give data about notarizations per time interval

[21-Aug-19 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think that is interesting

[21-Aug-19 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
we don't really have that data at all

[21-Aug-19 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it will be able to say "we had X notarizations per hour, on average, in the last month", stuff like that

[21-Aug-19 12:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
should be interesting to study the DPoW network with that data
