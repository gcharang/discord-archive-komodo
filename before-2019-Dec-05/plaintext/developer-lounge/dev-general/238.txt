but for android I guess I have to clone it from git

[01-Dec-19 09:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but not sure if I just need to clone it or will I need to compile that too?

[01-Dec-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
another dependencies I previous found in my own forked code was the need of gmp, sodium

[01-Dec-19 09:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
example this command:
```gcc -o runnspv runnspv.c -Iincludes/ -Iincludes/nspv -Iincludes/cryptoconditions -Iincludes/logdb -Iincludes/btc libcryptoconditions.a libbtc.a libsecp256k1.a -lgmp -levent -lsodium libnspv.a```

[01-Dec-19 09:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I guess I'll also need to fulfil all these dependencies with andorid ndk

[01-Dec-19 09:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
compiling libevent gave this:
```
configure: error: openssl is a must but can not be found. You should add the directory containing `openssl.pc' to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH' environment variable, or set `CFLAGS' and `LDFLAGS' directly for openssl, or use `--disable-openssl' to disable support for openssl encryption```

[01-Dec-19 09:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
😅

[01-Dec-19 09:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it will make me compile many different libs 😄

[01-Dec-19 09:55 AM] dimxy#2587
it is libcryptocondition depends on libsodium

[01-Dec-19 09:55 AM] dimxy#2587
seems openss-dev also needs to be installed

@phm87 thanks for links man!  That Alex boswoeth twitter (submarine swap dev/enabler) is quite opinionated!

[02-Dec-19 10:29 PM] phm87#7395
@Mylo please do not say too many kinds words of lightning network developers or other guys will kick you and me with sticks (I'm joking)

[02-Dec-19 10:31 PM] Mylo#8306
“Opinionated” ... depends if you like his opinion! 😝
I don’t (& presumably majority here) particularly like when someone has extreme rules as he tweets about “other P2P garbage” 😅

[02-Dec-19 10:31 PM] phm87#7395
alex bosworth created many stuff on LN but I also follow a little bit the black guy (I forgot his name) because they don't work on the same implementations I think

[02-Dec-19 10:32 PM] phm87#7395
I've never read his replies to other guys so I don't know details sorry, I always stick to technical

[02-Dec-19 10:33 PM] phm87#7395
(and as many BTC guys are against alts, it is not anormal that they kick a bit altcoiners)

[02-Dec-19 10:33 PM] Mylo#8306
The only LN I’m familiar with is CHIPS use.  Thanks for your following/knowledge on it.   All types of swaps are interesting even though I’m not a trader.

[02-Dec-19 10:33 PM] Mylo#8306
Haha ok altcoin prejudice

[02-Dec-19 10:34 PM] phm87#7395
Good thing with submarine swap is that you can swap between LN and altcoins onchain, the tool of alex should with with BCH I think that it worked with LTC

[02-Dec-19 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
I’ll check out LN more I guess, cheers

Hi! I would like to ask if you need a good C developer (paid), full or part time, to contribute to your project 🙂

[04-Dec-19 02:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Kenshiro contact @ca333

[04-Dec-19 02:50 PM] Kenshiro#7911
ok, thank you! 🙂

[04-Dec-19 02:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
np mate 👍

[04-Dec-19 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
OK, so I'm having an issue building komodod
`/bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: Unterminated quoted string`
I've narrowed it down to
<https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/beta/depends/funcs.mk#L147>
for some odd reason `$(PATH)` may or may not end with a ", any suggestions?

[04-Dec-19 04:59 PM] Oszy#5734
weird, this error indicates that " is missing but it's there?

[04-Dec-19 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
it's not there for some packages and others it is

[04-Dec-19 05:01 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
one time it will be like
`PATH="/home/computergenie/komodo_beta/depends/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/native/bin:/home/computergenie/.nvm/versions/node/v12.11.0/bin:/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games   `
and another
`PATH="/home/computergenie/komodo_beta/depends/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/native/bin:/home/computergenie/.nvm/versions/node/v12.11.0/bin:/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games"`

[04-Dec-19 05:10 PM] Oszy#5734
hmm try without " at all

[04-Dec-19 05:11 PM] Oszy#5734
`$(1)_config_env+=PATH=$(build_prefix)/bin:$(PATH)`

[04-Dec-19 05:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that gets me through some of the packages and then gives the `Unterminated quoted string` error later (that path begins with ")

[04-Dec-19 05:20 PM] Oszy#5734
oh crap i see what you mean

[04-Dec-19 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Oszy seems like you were on the right track
I removed the quotes from all 3 var lines and it works again
still not sure why it didn't to begin with, but it works now
thanks

[04-Dec-19 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, after literally hours of trying to sort this out...
my system `$PATH` variable ended with a literal `$` and that's what made it wonky

[04-Dec-19 08:03 PM] Oszy#5734
nice good to know
