There will be a web GUI of the sudoku game?

There for sure can be 😉

[22-Feb-19 07:24 AM] Mark81#4505
Also one idea came to my mind was that if players play as a team in multiplayer games and their data would be collected together making their team valuable. in that way their would create value from successful gaming performance as together.  which could be direct statistic for sponsors if they want to be involved with esport events with these teams.

it might also make market  for teams acquiring high valuable players for their teams. Also if team decide to get rid of player that would get portion of their wins from that divorce.

wonder if @forkwitch is still working on Casino chain/project 🤔

[02-Mar-19 02:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
was really looking forward to it's udpates

[02-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Meyse#0952
What casino chain/project? Kmdice?

[02-Mar-19 03:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
nope, it was a project known from kmdice early days

[05-Mar-19 01:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
is there somewhere an example to use Komodo for example with Unity engine (like Nethereum for web3) ?

[05-Mar-19 01:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(please tag me)

[05-Mar-19 01:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I probably can't port my current game, but I have this baby project I once did for a game jam, just to see if I can lab it

[05-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Mylo#8306
@TwilightPunkster K64 https://www.komodo-cakeshop.com/unity3d/ is so far the best start I’ve found

If you can code in C# I have a junior gamedev colleague at pioneers who is in the same boat as you,

[05-Mar-19 01:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Mylo awesome, thanks for that link

[05-Mar-19 01:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hehehe I can code in way too many languages (actually did some work on the Nethereum port and some hacks when still in the 3.5 backend with web3)

[05-Mar-19 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
Any questions just ask, I’m also keen to get a kmd package for unity working because it benefits any project.

Ok cool lmk if I can assist, I’m not c# player 😃

[05-Mar-19 01:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably gonna write a plugin for it, but as it seems now, it will take some months before I can actually invest in it

[05-Mar-19 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
But can explain kmd and test for u

[05-Mar-19 01:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, you can do C++ in Unity too, basically DLL the stuff and expose

[05-Mar-19 01:42 AM] Mylo#8306
Ah in that case...

[05-Mar-19 01:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but C# in Unity isn't like the real stuff anyway, its mono.

[05-Mar-19 01:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I've only worked with web3/Ethereum so far (the bc vendors are mostly in that area)

ah, that source looks mostly like a simple RPC client

[05-Mar-19 01:44 AM] Mylo#8306
Is the C++ in unity available to all supported platforms?

[05-Mar-19 01:44 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah that’s all you want to get the ball rolling.

[05-Mar-19 01:45 AM] Mylo#8306
Having chain running on same machine will do for v1beta.  We can get all the signing code into a cpp library

[05-Mar-19 01:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, you can't natively compile within Unity, but basically, you create either C# dylibs that convert to native through Visual Studio, or just separate the  whole DLL and expose its methods in Unity.

(pretty simple process)

[05-Mar-19 02:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Mylo just browsed through your code, shouldn't take long to port to Unity plugin. I have a meeting with my accelerator on Thursday, maybe they are interested for a next project with using Komodo (probably gotta take some time anyway, as I am unfamiliar with the toolchain)

[05-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Mylo#8306
@TwilightPunkster K64 cool, that is @ca333 original code.  Any of us and @barv can assist in many areas.

@Mylo awesome thanks. I probably not gonna show off Rogue, I do my own POC's 😛

[05-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Mylo#8306
OK @TwilightPunkster K64 - well...for you PoC, just send some REST requests out of your game, i can massage it into an oracle to create a “game protocol” for it’s state.  Similar to the “supply chain research” in the tech-Tuesday #7 link.  Just simple json stuff for a PoC.

[05-Mar-19 03:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that sounds awesome, thanks @Mylo

[07-Mar-19 12:47 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions heya!

[07-Mar-19 12:47 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
welcome to the world of crypto!

[07-Mar-19 12:48 PM] fmproductions#2904
thanks! will be a lot of new stuff in here for sure

[07-Mar-19 12:48 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically, I need a port of my Unity crap to Unreal

[07-Mar-19 12:48 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
short simple history of things

[07-Mar-19 12:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@fmproductions welcome!

[07-Mar-19 12:49 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I came in, looking for a plugin, didn't find one, wrapped one myself

[07-Mar-19 12:49 PM] fmproductions#2904
hello cryptofist, and thx!

[07-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm here to help if you need anything.

[07-Mar-19 12:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
figured out it didn't work with Ethereum crap (these guys are on top of Bitcoin crazy stuff), so I made a fancy LUA-like language to simulate it, which I've named 6AM (at the time I finished  it), which is basically running in a JS sandbox.

[07-Mar-19 12:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, eventually, I am gonna need to doc it, but you can't have a Unity SDK without an Unreal SDK

{Reactions}
treasure (3) 

[07-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, tech wacky stuff, JSON RPC client, that basically runs async, to create thingies on the blockchain (Komodo platform)

[07-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I tested the Unity thingie on Twilight Punkster Galaxy this morning and it was working twice the time faster than Loom, probably because there is no Ethereum VM underneath

[07-Mar-19 12:53 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, some other dude wants to make him a cool Warcraft 2 game like demo, which will be easy, and I wanna test this against it.

[07-Mar-19 12:53 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, do you remember my Udemy project?

[07-Mar-19 12:55 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist this is my friend and fellow indie developer @fmproductions who I've worked with before, has Unreal, C++ experience and knows how horrible my coding can be, and has the same bad taste in jokes.

{Reactions}
😄 

[07-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Excellent!

[07-Mar-19 12:56 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions my new buddy @Cryptofist loves gamedevs and has a merchandise dream (yup, t-shirts and swag), but really wants to dig into things that are not-technical

[07-Mar-19 12:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Would you having your own chain and tokens built on that chain also be responsible for speed ? 
With Ethereum it would have just been tokens on their chain, so you're speed is partly based on how congested the ETH network is... Correct?

[07-Mar-19 12:57 PM] fmproductions#2904
cool stuff!

[07-Mar-19 12:57 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup yup

[07-Mar-19 12:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, the awesomeness is in the fact they got everything I already could think off, ONE tiny fugliness

[07-Mar-19 12:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I will pump meta data in a field called description, and use a guid in a field called name

[07-Mar-19 12:58 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so its cosmetically a pain for our perfectionist eyes, but I decided I can live with it

[07-Mar-19 12:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, so 6AM is the replacement that otherwise would be Solidity, but I figured out 2 hours ago, I can transpile Solidity version 3-4 to my beautiful 6AM syntax

[07-Mar-19 12:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Happy to see another games dev here 
Welcome @fmproductions 🙂

[07-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, maybe maybe a little bit of haxory there!

[07-Mar-19 01:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder yeah, I invited him to come here to port my Unity stuff to Unreal

[07-Mar-19 01:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions ok, so 6AM looks like the following (still need to document it properly, but you'll get it right away)

[07-Mar-19 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't make me excited++
M already excited with all things you guys doing

[07-Mar-19 01:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

sorry no highlights, because well, new language

[07-Mar-19 01:02 PM] jorian#4555
6AM. Perfect

[07-Mar-19 01:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions these guys have made a retro game on their blockchain called Rogue.

[07-Mar-19 01:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions it was my first fisher price test

[07-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Added Blockchain to the original 1980 BSD Rogue game.

{Reactions}
😃 

[07-Mar-19 01:03 PM] fmproductions#2904
how does the game use the blockchain tech?

[07-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
You can exit the game by quiting, this will save your character stats and items in your pack as a token.

[07-Mar-19 01:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
anyways, 6AM has a decent lexi, no loops (no for/while), only an each to iterate through lists

[07-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
In addition, your game gold is converted to ROGUE our coin on chain.

[07-Mar-19 01:05 PM] fmproductions#2904
so, basically your save file is decentralized stored in a pretty secure way?

[07-Mar-19 01:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions basically in a short version; a NFT (its called a non-fungible token), which in our terms would be a Serialized Object with at max 6 fields, that will always be unique

{Reactions}
👌 

[07-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
There's a built in exchange system a well, as marketplace to buy and sell your character tokens

[07-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
AND

[07-Mar-19 01:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions see it as a super duper persistent database with haxy paxy snaxy features

[07-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
...

[07-Mar-19 01:06 PM] fmproductions#2904
alright

[07-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
instead of save files, worse

[07-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
here goes

[07-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It saves the gameplay keystrokes so games can be replayed and verified

[07-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
"inventory items"

[07-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
la la la struuuuuctttsssss

[07-Mar-19 01:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so what does 6AM between that layer of cryptocashymagic and sharedgameassetbundledata stuck in engine containers?

[07-Mar-19 01:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
superparse!

[07-Mar-19 01:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The gold conversion means you're getting paid in real currency to play.

[07-Mar-19 01:07 PM] fmproductions#2904
oh, interesting. 
I heard that blockchain data is permanently stored and not edited, I am wondering, with a lot of games or other applications for block chain, won't there ever be a storage issue?

[07-Mar-19 01:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist you'd be surprised, but we aren't that much into the money thingie

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions decentralization sir

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Just a feature. 😉

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
ROGUE has unforgeable player data as there isnt even player data submitted. only the game keystrokes are

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, le data is le petite

[07-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
and from that the player data is recreated on each node to verify it
