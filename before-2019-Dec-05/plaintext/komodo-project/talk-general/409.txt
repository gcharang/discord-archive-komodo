@radix42 as per jl777: Current requirements are 1.5 MB of disk space and 3 MB of RAM. Those are megabytes, not gigabytes!

@Vic_EXCC you might want to post in #talk-marketing 
when you say added, do you mean as payment option?

[14-Aug-19 11:23 AM] bogybogy#3962
- the danger that the big companies and financial institutions don't  partner with crypto projects , instead they will do their own thing. And now you see it, supply chain, ID verification, storage etc.... they are using their own consortium chains and for the publc part ( when benefitting ) they use ETH. If STOs or SME financing become a big thing - they could go for it easily too. They have the tech, the devs, the money and most important - they have already the clients + investors. I can understand now why Andreas M. Antonopoulos is always preaching the 5 must haves for crypto blockchains: open, public, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant. Perhaps i am wrong, but this crash cycle made me finally very picky. Beside that i have still problems to figure out how different POS and governance systems are able to capture network value by using utility tokens. Or what DPOS chains have to do to avoid centralization. I asked this question h TG chats - no answer - perhaps someone here knows it:

[14-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Vic_EXCC#0810
@smk762 -  dracocanis ominator cheers and yes, we resell DigitalOcean servers (for now) with crypto and KMD is one of the payment options.

I   have tons of Idea on different metrics but limited resources.. working 1 day at a time

[14-Aug-19 12:50 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
With CoinCodeCap I just not want to show data... I also want to cultivate data.. an example.. a lot of project do weekly or monthly updates reports..they can  publish it on CoinCodeCap.. which contributes to their rating.. these small small things which makes a project more accountable ..and a single place to understand how development is going on

Now everything is scattered and no actual process a project can follow to inform about their development to investors .. 

With CoinCodeCap I want to solve this

[14-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a very good approach!

I know this isn't really a dICO, but there's a swiss company hoping to run an ICO adhering to KYC regulation, and have a few thousand dollars to put into a good ICO dashboard. I want to support komodo/the community so if it's possible to do (not really decentralized), would anyone be willing to give a quote? 
Here are the requirements;
Presale of NFT indicating a set SuperNode, which will receive a % of bought back tokens quarterly.
Main sale of regular currency.
Competitive supernodes: quarterly top 10 holders are locked in for next quarter, receiving same benefits as set Supernodes.

Their main application is built on HyperLedger, and the main use of the token will be purchase of their services. 

If this is possible, please send any quote you have 😄 Thanks in advance, and I hope I can inject a bit of support to the Komodo community if possible. (Don't undersell yourself, and give as realistic a quote as possible).

[16-Aug-19 06:14 AM] JohnnyC#2488

[16-Aug-19 06:31 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@JohnnyC that sounds like a lot of work for a few thousand dollars.
If they just want a chain created, they do premine for 100% then they have a website doing KYC and then allocate the premine to their users, that should be simple enough

[16-Aug-19 07:07 AM] JohnnyC#2488
A few thousand plus* 
They got a quote for 7k from an eth dashboard (likely from template) plus SCs, but I know that's on the very low end, and they're pretty open

[16-Aug-19 07:09 AM] JohnnyC#2488
And yea, that plus a bit of additional setup for nodes would be a huge help.

But price wise, that's why I was asking for quotes 😄
