I try to emulate it @PTYX - I see it too.  Pretty impressive.    I wish they were a little more inclusive to non dev types.    I always feel out of place.

in PoW mining this is sidestepped by just defining that the one with most hashrate is the real chain, but it doesnt work so well in other cases unless it is very very carefully designed

I think this is a major first in the US, where you previously could only pay taxes with USD.  In Ohio it is now legal to pay your state taxes with BTC.   https://www.marketplace.org/2019/04/08/world/ohio-experiments-bitcoin-tax-payments

@phm87   thanks for posting that.  It is reassuring to read that: ```The VBK token barely reached double its IEO price for a brief moment, before dropping below its initial sale price a day later.```

I wonder if OP_RETURN will be adjusted downwards back to 40 bytes?  That could kill them,  DPoW will fit in that and be safe, correct?

Oh how I miss the '80s sometimes when I see all the stuff we used to play with. The computers back then had a certain grace and appeal to them, and as long as I live they will be retro to the degree that I always wish they would come back in some new incarnated form. Even tho...

Hi everyone.   I was at the CIS meetup party last night.  I gotta tell you, not one single person I spoke to knew you could launch on Komodo like you can on ERC... not one person except the guy I went with.

more or less like I see on twitter, it's a miracle if a big name / influencer mentions Komodo. This  has somewhat improved recently, but the very big ones are still far from reach

The ecosystem is growing fast. Komodo will inevitably get attention by sheer massive superiority. Either they will start paying attention or they will not even see what hit them...

[09-Apr-19 03:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I’m hoping for the latter,  we will have more chains than coins on CMC before they recognize , but they too will bend the knee 👑

[09-Apr-19 03:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That may not be too difficult,  every system that needs isolated by country is 200+ chains

[09-Apr-19 03:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Then function isolation chains,  like how z transactions will be with komodo will add a bunch more

It has to be intuitive but most importantly it has to work. If you walk away from it, orders can't disappear or get locked so you have to do mental gymnastics to unlock the funds.

[09-Apr-19 03:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`not exactly equal to centralized systems`
true, but if JoeX on the other side of the world "took" the trade you though you were going to, then your trade dies, and that's a fact of P2P that we all have to live with

[09-Apr-19 03:33 PM] Regnar#6164
What's the API/Bot support looking like for the new MM?

[09-Apr-19 03:33 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Having good ux doesn't imply that it must work like centralized thing, you can be decentralized and still have a good experience. It only means trying to have as a good ux as possible. And that makes all the difference between having a small niche userbase or a much larger market

[09-Apr-19 03:35 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`HyperDEX' success proves it.`
I spent 2 weeks trying to use that thing and got 1 trade; so, ymmv

[09-Apr-19 03:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I still think a good initial step to get liquidity and orders up are to convert those who are already providing liquidity to other p2p trading and are cool with 24/7 uptime. My recommendation was OpenBazaar crypto-crypto sellers. I see no reason for them to be using escrow or just trust when we could have great partnership

[09-Apr-19 03:37 PM] Regnar#6164
I doubt OB would be cool with BarterDEX fees though, I think that's against their whole model

[09-Apr-19 03:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
actually it is, because it's forced electrum which sux for those of us that don't live in a metropolis

[09-Apr-19 03:39 PM] PTYX#6840
I was able to use hyperdex during its first releases. Towards the last ones I complained about not being able to complete a single trade in months

[09-Apr-19 03:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm2 doesn't magically make electrum suck less

[09-Apr-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
but, overall impression is better with MM2 + electrum

[09-Apr-19 03:41 PM] SHossain#0007
compared to MM1 version + electrum

[09-Apr-19 03:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I was able to do dozens of swaps on win using  electrum with mm1 GUI ,   It worked and I’m not too tech minded. Main thing I found the problem was the JS side of things

[09-Apr-19 03:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
if the guy that's producing 99% of SN blocks can't make a SN trade on electrum (that he can make native), there's an issue with electrum (or the "just an interface" that's forcing him to use electrum is actively blocking it)
imo

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`because of mm1`
is horseshit
I literally was making thousands of trades native

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, native performed solid

[09-Apr-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
electrum has/had few downsides

[09-Apr-19 03:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
mm1 has its issues, but electrum compounds it

[09-Apr-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
mm1 didnt have any electrum support intended

[09-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
after it was working, electrum support was added, but of course it wasnt exactly designed in

[09-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so it depends on reliable electrum servers, but they disconnect after 10 errors. cipi modified it to wait until 1000 errors

[09-Apr-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the fact that via cli it works much better indicates the issue is electrum

[09-Apr-19 04:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so having a gui that uses the mode that is less reliable.... give us the choice of easier to user gui with less reliable electrum, or harder to use barterDEX gui with native

[09-Apr-19 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if hyperdex worked with native, then i would imagine it would have been just fine, but then people will say that "nobody wants to run a full node"

[09-Apr-19 04:03 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`if hyperdex worked with native, then i would imagine it would have been just fine`
imo, it would have been better than "just fine" and as pretty as it is I likely would be its greatest proponent

[09-Apr-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
if it works, it works

[09-Apr-19 04:15 PM] PTYX#6840
the hyperdex definitely didn't work most of the time

[09-Apr-19 04:16 PM] PTYX#6840
the mobile dex looks promising. if the action is the same as the demo, it should be good

[09-Apr-19 04:33 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Mostly nobody wants to run a full node.`
