Thank you. This one is safe? The last Agama hack makes me very causcious.

@farl ledger nano x (s) together with https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/ works like a charm.

Good to hear that! Will look into it! 👍🏻

[05-Sep-19 10:25 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah both work fine. Both are free as wellm

[05-Sep-19 10:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@farl when it comes to safest, I count on the best security practice of the paranoids.
using a dedicated device, synced full node of that cryptocurrency which you have tokens of and which you value the most, compiled from source code, only command line and without any user interface, and only running this command line daemon on that machine and no use of any other software or service on that machine except this dedicated use. running it over tor + firewall setup, you can do simple commands for komodo like "sendtoaddress" to send the funds from your own address to your own address holding the funds, every month, to accrue and get rewards.

[05-Sep-19 10:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the less the other softwares there are on the OS which you are using for this cryptocurrency the less the chances of messing up and losing your valuable tokens.

[05-Sep-19 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and it's not that hard to setup this way.

[05-Sep-19 10:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm.... I guess I can agree if a user is a linux newbie 😛

[05-Sep-19 10:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true, for a linux newbie a tutorial always helps

[05-Sep-19 10:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think there should be a paranoids' guide to using Komodo too 😉

[05-Sep-19 12:09 PM] farl#9964
Yes, I know him. Will look into it. 👍🏻 Thx guys!

[05-Sep-19 12:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@grewalsatinder you still might expose your private keys whereas a ledger will not.

[05-Sep-19 12:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once Luke has some more time, the ledgerclaim site will allow users to download it and store a local copy so they wont even need to go to the site.

[05-Sep-19 12:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@hyperDEX can't disagree on that mate.
Paranoia says don't trust ledger's servers serving blockchain to their devices, and be afraid of the firmware attacks.

[05-Sep-19 12:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are two point of views that I am referring to, the usual, and paranoids 😅

[05-Sep-19 12:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The other option which @Deleted User was working on was a multisig setup, having say 3 yubikeys

[05-Sep-19 12:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That would be cool

[05-Sep-19 12:26 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Paranoids just are crazy, there is kinda no end to it

[05-Sep-19 12:26 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yep, there is a fine balance between being safe and being so inconvenient that you dont want to do anything  😄

[05-Sep-19 12:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Exactly

[05-Sep-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Well this is what i would suggest. Get the seed bip39 generator for komodo. On a offline PC have that there. Go to ledger, get the 24 words

[05-Sep-19 12:28 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Punch that into the generator, you will get a list of addresses and privkeys

[05-Sep-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then every time you claim you check against your list to make sure the address that it generates you have the privkey for

[05-Sep-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe there is a way to point the blockchain data it uses to your own node too

[05-Sep-19 12:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then you should have the best of both worlds

[05-Sep-19 12:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
When i say offline PC, i mean like never connected to the internet with wifi removed physically and a RJ45 cable chopped off and connected to the PC so you dont accidentally connect something.

[05-Sep-19 12:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes, that's also a good idea

[05-Sep-19 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was also thinking another thing

[05-Sep-19 12:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
using libnspv as a replacement of full node on an offline computer

[05-Sep-19 12:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that means having a libnspv installed on a offline computer with network connections devices/parts removed physically.

[05-Sep-19 12:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but to take the necessary data for libnspv from another online device and feed it to the the offline libnspv

[05-Sep-19 12:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
check and view the basic transactions info from offline libnspv and create a signed transaction which you can take a copy of and braodcast from the online device using nspv

[05-Sep-19 12:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c thoughts ?

[05-Sep-19 12:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand that there's no such data saved by libnspv on the disk, but only in the run time memory

[05-Sep-19 12:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@blackjok3r

[05-Sep-19 12:39 PM] hyperDEX#6586
what if the data is saved to a removable device?

[05-Sep-19 12:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Like a USB, but once the USB touches the offline device it should be destroyed 😛

[05-Sep-19 12:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the reason I thought of libnspv as replacement for offline full node was the need to copy the GBs of data needed to copy from online device to an offline device to check on latest blockchain data to create a transaction.

[05-Sep-19 12:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with libnspv, that will be in MBs

[05-Sep-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
`The other option which @Emmanuel was working on was a multisig setup, having say 3 yubikeys`
@hyperDEX this sounds very interesting. Yubikeys for blockchain sounds awesome.

Hmmm true...

[05-Sep-19 01:23 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
@ca333 any issues with atomic dex not being listed on play store ?

[05-Sep-19 01:49 PM] ca333#0118
@siu - Chainmakers - the app was just listed for pre-registrations recently which we removed. We are in the process of releasing version 0.1.7 this week which will become publicly available (as a public beta release). This will likely be the version for the first stress test stage. However, registered users are still able to download/install the app from playstore. Just DM us your playstore attached email address if that is not the case.

@grewalsatinder `the reason I thought of libnspv as replacement for offline full node was the need to copy the GBs of data needed to copy from online device to an offline device to check on latest blockchain data to create a transaction.` don't need to copy GBs to sign something, just scriptPubKey, the vout number and txid

@hyperDEX i think that there's virtually little risk using ledger on a web browser right?

[05-Sep-19 08:51 PM] PTYX#6840
One could argue a web interface is less risky than downloading software to your local desktop

[05-Sep-19 08:51 PM] PTYX#6840
If used with ledger that is

Too much drama around Komodo /k64/Redfox

For a big investor that would be a big RED FLAG.

distracting people is the way KMD people handle the situation, not arguing about facts, but deviating to personal matters

It’s certainly not a way to protect your investors from leaving

[05-Sep-19 09:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`all the drama is bad for the all ecosystem/ project itself `
That depends on the topic and context
Not all "drama" is bad and not all prolonged discussion about differing sides of a topic is "drama"
The bit that becomes bad is when the personal attacks start, then someone gets in their feelz, drops the topic, and it all becomes about "I have to get him for him getting me"

[05-Sep-19 09:17 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Drama itself can cause obviously awareness but it doesn’t mean it’s a good one

[05-Sep-19 09:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Investors have to know, that's the point of all this

[05-Sep-19 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm just saying that not everything that's been labeled "drama" and "fighting" actually is 🤷🏽

[05-Sep-19 09:18 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s getting to a point where people are starting to take it personal as you said and that’s when ***. Hits the fan

[05-Sep-19 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`How can’t they , I would also `
It's simple, stick to facts; facts aren't personal attacks

[05-Sep-19 09:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
deviating from facts to personal attacks, or calling fud is just neglecting the facts in themselves

[05-Sep-19 09:20 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s a very thin line between that and often people tend to lean to the personal side

It’s how humans are and if you study the human brain you would have know as you said based on ‘facts’ that’s indeed what tends to happen

[05-Sep-19 09:21 PM] Buddz1993#5380
It’s the way how people resolve their issues  that makes the difference .

we could literally debate "partly cloudy" vs "mostly sunny" until the end of eternity and it wouldn't become "drama" until one of us directed a comment at the other and it went un-ignored
