Right my thought is that we could expand docs to cover them as well.

@groundhog do you mean the auto smart chain launcher or the antara modules or the dex?

it is not free to use as the nodes and related infrastructure needed to launch a blockchain cost money

[18-Sep-19 05:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@groundhog  you can spawn a chain with cli for free ( infrastructure not included )

[18-Sep-19 05:30 PM] groundhog#0062

[18-Sep-19 05:31 PM] groundhog#0062
so we make all the settings on the cli? manual as we would usem them on antara launcher later?

[18-Sep-19 05:33 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Either that or launch from your Testnet straight to production,  but would have to arrange DPoW and other integrations independently through our service providers

[18-Sep-19 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
the Antara composer is a graphical interface to what you can do on the cli as well

[18-Sep-19 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
the difference is that the composer asks money, the cli doesn't

[18-Sep-19 05:34 PM] jorian#4555
there is a bunch of documentation that can help you set things up on the cli

[18-Sep-19 05:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Composer also deploys servers and includes DPoW

Hi @groundhog , we have some test chains set up in #kmdlabs that I've recently tested tokens on.

[18-Sep-19 10:41 PM] CrisF#3405
Free to test on those.

[18-Sep-19 10:43 PM] CrisF#3405
Our chains have dPow so you can also test things requiring that.

@jspook16 yea I believe it's active in the most recent version of Chameleon. There are a ton of places to get giftcards, you could easily live off them

[19-Sep-19 11:45 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah it's available on major cryptocurrency like KMD, BTC, Eth, Dash and so forth

@xeonrider antara is being worked on still and that's one of the reasons there aren't any tutorials yet.
