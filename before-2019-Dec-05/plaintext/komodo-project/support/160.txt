your funds didn't move from your original address. they are still in there https://kmdexplorer.io/address/RFoTEZPDScVbXrkN1WytMv6SUC3DcRsBxA

[08-Jul-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
you used your funds on 11th June

[08-Jul-19 08:29 PM] SHossain#0007
to claim reward

[08-Jul-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
you have been claiming reward every month.

[08-Jul-19 08:30 PM] stricrypto#3482
Ok great.......but how do I reinstate my wallet pse?

[08-Jul-19 08:30 PM] SHossain#0007
how did you use your wallet on 11th June?

[08-Jul-19 08:30 PM] stricrypto#3482
I cannot see my funds in the wallet.....

[08-Jul-19 08:30 PM] stricrypto#3482
I logged in as usual

[08-Jul-19 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
i don't know what is your usual way

[08-Jul-19 08:31 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have the seed or private key for that address which you use to login?

[08-Jul-19 08:32 PM] stricrypto#3482
Yes. I think I simply need a link to reset my agama wallet by using the seed key I still have for the original wallet.

[08-Jul-19 08:32 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have the seed key?

[08-Jul-19 08:32 PM] stricrypto#3482
Yes I do

[08-Jul-19 08:33 PM] SHossain#0007

I've given up on trying to recover this account. If anyone wants to attempt to recover 5.00010005KMD here's the information. You can keep the KMD obviously but I wouldn't mind knowing how it was done. The following produced that address only once after initial account setup.

Komodo

Seed words

New Safe Address - RPVRttmUM8dVebFWV6vZvh6hzKf2GF7EEz

The old compromised address which is accessible had the following setup information and shows the dust being sent to this address.

Agama (Komodo)

[08-Jul-19 08:57 PM] SHossain#0007
@TheFalseProfit never post seed

[08-Jul-19 08:58 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I also have the QR code made at the time which can be read with  Code two free software but I don't know how to upload it.

[08-Jul-19 08:58 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
I couldn't care less about those accounts at this point.

[08-Jul-19 09:01 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
The address handling by agama is abysmal. I won't be trusting it anytime soon and that's only  one of a number of problems I came across in 3 days  of messing about with the wallet. I like Komodo but jeeeez.

[08-Jul-19 09:04 PM] SHossain#0007
@TheFalseProfit i have about 50 different seeds and in the last about 2 years Agama never generated a wrong address as long as i had the seed correct.

[08-Jul-19 09:05 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Main lesson learnt = Get WIF straight away. ONLY reliable way to get an address back.

[08-Jul-19 09:11 PM] TheFalseProfit#5929
Yes, well I've produced it a number of times on two computers and others have complained of the same thing. The trouble is it only happens now and again and I'm out of time and patience to do the 10 odd screenshots over and over until it reproduces. 

It may have something to do with going in with the new seed first time, but second time going in with the password. At which point the second address may stick, or they both produce different address's, or other variations. It's intermittent. I'm past caring.

[08-Jul-19 09:13 PM] SHossain#0007
i still have seed from Komodo ICO which still generates the same address

[08-Jul-19 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
do you use notepad or wordpad or MS Word?

[08-Jul-19 09:14 PM] SHossain#0007
notepad is the best way to store or just simply write them down in a piece of paper

[08-Jul-19 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
wordpad or MS word messes up with seed

[08-Jul-19 09:15 PM] SHossain#0007
because of encoding

[08-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Guys the crypto.com has listed Komodo quite a while ago I asked their team why is it taking so long for them to have the withdrawals for Komodo enabled and they said this ‘The app needs to be integrated with their chain. The Komodo team are working on it, they may have more info?’

[08-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Malti#3948
@Yu what exactly did you want to ask about your claim? If you have fulfilled all steps in the process, you would just need to wait until your claim is processed. No worries tho, funds are safu

[08-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Do you have any eta when this will be done I’m missing my rewards because of that .

[08-Jul-19 10:32 PM] Malti#3948
@Buddz1993 this might have something to do with the chain update that is scheduled for the 15th of July if I’m not mistaken. @SHossain can confirm

[08-Jul-19 10:33 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Huum I see if knew this I would have bought on binance or bittrex because now I have quite a few hundred stuck there when I could be earning my rewards 😅

[08-Jul-19 10:34 PM] Portypete#5024
can anyone help me with the reclaiming of funds from the hack.. im having trouble moving funds from one address to another.

[08-Jul-19 10:34 PM] Portypete#5024
kmd

[08-Jul-19 10:35 PM] Malti#3948
@Buddz1993 sorry to hear that. I’m afk now but if you remind me tomorrow I’ll send some kmd your way using the tipbot (that I need to load up) 😉

[08-Jul-19 10:35 PM] Portypete#5024
im trying to get this done as soon as possible.

[08-Jul-19 10:36 PM] Malti#3948

But sucks to have my Komodo stuck there where I could be earning my beloved rewards 😞

[08-Jul-19 10:38 PM] Malti#3948
Indeed, that’s what CEX’s do. Luckily atomicDEX beta is almost live and that will be  a problem of the past

[08-Jul-19 10:40 PM] Buddz1993#5380
Indeed !

[09-Jul-19 01:46 AM] house#8741
Logging in to Hyperdex after long time, I notice my ETH has moved. Looking at the date (7th June) that it was transfered out, I am guessing that it was moved to a safe address because of the agama hack.
What should I do now to proceed with a claim?

[09-Jul-19 01:48 AM] house#8741
I see dust in the wallet

[09-Jul-19 01:59 AM] PTYX#6840
@house did you ever use that seed in Agama?

[09-Jul-19 02:00 AM] house#8741
yea ... that was the original seed, but I transfered to the account using barterdex

[09-Jul-19 02:01 AM] house#8741
wouldn't matter I expect whatever was in that account would have been compromised

[09-Jul-19 02:03 AM] PTYX#6840
ok yeah i was just curious

Hi! I only filled one form for claiming the funds ... got my KMD back allready. Above to that i got small amounts of the assets which were safed at my compromised address. I already transfer them to the new address like i did it with KMD ... but i don‘t get the assets. Do i have to fill every single form even i did the transfer allready?

[09-Jul-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

@TL use this guide to claim rewards using KkomodoOceanQT wallet https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000030305-use-komodo-ocean-qt-wallet-to-claim-rewards

[09-Jul-19 12:40 PM] TimTim#2040
Regarding this :-

[09-Jul-19 12:40 PM] TimTim#2040
you can use bootstrap for qt: https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php place it extracted in the same folder as komodo.conf

I'm still not getting anywhere using oceanQT. Is there anything that need deleting perhaps?

[09-Jul-19 12:41 PM] TimTim#2040
PS I'm using Linux.

[09-Jul-19 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
what is your actual issue?

[09-Jul-19 12:53 PM] TimTim#2040
I'm trying to load the BC from the bootstrap file using oceanQT

[09-Jul-19 12:54 PM] TimTim#2040
I have extracted it and placed it in the same folder as komodo.conf

[09-Jul-19 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
did it not work?

[09-Jul-19 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
what is your actual issue now after extracting bootstrap data inside data dir?

[09-Jul-19 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
did you start KomodoOceanQT wallet after extracting bootstrap?

[09-Jul-19 12:59 PM] TimTim#2040
Yes, of course, it's just stuck on "syncing headers"

[09-Jul-19 01:00 PM] TimTim#2040
Do I need to make "chainstate" and "blocks" on the root of the data directory as opposed to "KMD-bootstrap"??

[09-Jul-19 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, they should be in root dir `~/.komodo` as where the `komodo.conf` file is and not inside `KMD-bootstrap` dir

[09-Jul-19 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
`I have extracted it and placed it in the same folder as komodo.conf`
you mentioned that you have already done it

[09-Jul-19 01:04 PM] TimTim#2040
But my komodo.conf is not in the hidden .komodo dir. It's where I originally extracted it.

[09-Jul-19 01:06 PM] TimTim#2040
OK, theres an existing .komodo from my agama installation. Guessing the new wallet decided to leave it intact.

[09-Jul-19 01:06 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. seems you are confused. there shouldn't be any `KMD-bootstrap` dir. copy all contents from KMD-bootstrap dir and paste them in `.komodo` dir

[09-Jul-19 01:06 PM] SHossain#0007
can you do that?

[09-Jul-19 01:06 PM] TimTim#2040
Shall I just completely wipe the old .komodo > place bootstrap there > restart?

[09-Jul-19 01:07 PM] SHossain#0007
stop KomodoOceanQT before

[09-Jul-19 01:07 PM] TimTim#2040
Yep, will do.

[09-Jul-19 01:08 PM] TimTim#2040
Shall I just nuke the existing .komodo dir first though??

[09-Jul-19 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no need

[09-Jul-19 01:09 PM] TimTim#2040
ok

[09-Jul-19 02:16 PM] TimTim#2040
@SHossain , ok thanks man, we have lift off. Basically I was told to use the same dir as komodo.conf. Unfortunately that appears BOTH in the hidden and the same working dir the qt is extracted to. I picked the wrong one I guess. Anyway, all ok now, thanks again!!

[09-Jul-19 02:17 PM] SHossain#0007
glad that your issue is sorted

[09-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Vinny#0983
If I moved my funds from the KMD Agama wallet to the Verus one, but accidentally used my verus private key on my KMD Agama wallet (didn’t make any transactions) several days ago, am I still safe?

[09-Jul-19 03:38 PM] jl777c#5810
hacker is active and is stealing any funds sent to compromised addresses

[09-Jul-19 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
putting passphrase into compromised KMD agama is how it gets compromised. if you have any large amount you do not want to lose, best to move to a new address

[09-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Vinny#0983
Even if I didn’t send to a conpromised address?

[09-Jul-19 03:51 PM] Vinny#0983
It was a new verus coin address that I used to access the old Agama app accidentally

sending has nothing to do with being compromised

[09-Jul-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a keylogger, that logs your passphrase. we believe it has been disabled, but it is on a third party site and we cant be 100% sure
