Hello 😃 Im here first time ☺️ Its about refunding the lost coins. I made this claiming fill in and Im still waiting to get my coins back. Today I read I have to send these 0,00x coins who are still on the old address to my new address where I hope to get my balance back. Who do I have to give the TxID for that? What is the next step?

[12-Jun-19 08:29 AM] Stefanek#6011
yes I send it

Hi guys and girls. How do I add RFOX to versus agama wallet? Thank you

[12-Jun-19 09:51 AM] Gigantos#3566
Thx Komodo team all my funds are back :Komodo: 👍

[12-Jun-19 09:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@BOenster 
RFOX isn't available in Verus Agama yet
you can use the qt-wallet in native mode, i.e., download the blockchain

you can dm me if you get stuck

Hey. This perhaps is a question for the Verus discord, but I'm trying to move the dust I recieved of other coins, like CHIPS, to my new address from the verus wallet (v0.6), and am getting an "incorrect pub key" error, as well as a "balance less than 10000 fee" (which I think is a VRSC thing that just pops up for other coins?)

[12-Jun-19 12:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@nasbats you can ignore the "balance less than 10000 fee" and the payment goes through
for chips: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029965-moving-chips-to-a-new-address

[12-Jun-19 12:17 PM] nasbats#7785
OK, that's what I thought, because I encountered the same thing moving my KMD.  So really, the problem is it doesn't recognize my new address as valid, so the transaction won't go through

[12-Jun-19 12:22 PM] nasbats#7785
Oh, I didn't read the full instrctions. I guess I need to send from Decker's wallet

[12-Jun-19 12:55 PM] private guy#0631
is there any coordination with CEXs (coinexchange.io; unsure if there’s others) to help take komodo assets out of wallet maintenance, or is KMD team handling refunds first?

[12-Jun-19 12:56 PM] private guy#0631
or are CEXs on their own?

@gcharang thanks. I didn’t know if I should change the settings on old wallet. I will try that later

[12-Jun-19 03:21 PM] Janette#4272
Hello at all.  I have received a small contribution on my compromised wallet. However already on 7 June. I filled in the form to refund days later. Is that already the test amount? Or is it still coming?
Thank you.

[12-Jun-19 03:22 PM] SHossain#0007
DM me your details @Janette

[12-Jun-19 03:23 PM] gcharang#6833
@Punk don't use the old Agama at all
use the old seed in the Verus Agama

I am already earning rewards in the Ocean Wallet for KMD.  Do they automatically get paid at some point?  I don't see a claim button like the Agama wallet had ....

[12-Jun-19 03:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
send the balance to yourself to claim

[12-Jun-19 03:46 PM] spudboy999#5256
@mrlynch   Can do ... thank you for the help...

[12-Jun-19 03:49 PM] spudboy999#5256
Any concerns over ZPOOL..CA having 92% of the KMD hashing power?  Can't they do nefarious things to the blockchain once they have more than 51%?

[12-Jun-19 03:50 PM] CHMEX#0686
70%-75% of blocks are mined by notaries

[12-Jun-19 03:51 PM] CHMEX#0686
So no - kmd stores also notarizations on btc

[12-Jun-19 03:51 PM] spudboy999#5256
ok thats good to know...thank you

[12-Jun-19 04:12 PM] Punk#1349
@gcharang thanks for clarification.

[12-Jun-19 05:05 PM] RNI#2666
hi. do we get rewards in verus agama? i got my coins back since 9th july but no rewards to claim yet

[12-Jun-19 05:07 PM] RNI#2666
ah sorry .. just saw that i first have to click on "check utxo" to claim ..

[12-Jun-19 05:08 PM] RNI#2666

[12-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Brainzz#5375

[12-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Brainzz#5375

[12-Jun-19 08:00 PM] Brainzz#5375
do i activate it in light or native mode?

[12-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Brainzz#5375
damn it! sorry to be a pain the neck. almost there.

[12-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Brainzz#5375
in step 5 in the pinned message, do i log out of the newly created wallet, then back in the old compromised wallet to transfer the funds?

[12-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Brainzz#5375
how do i import the old seed?

[12-Jun-19 08:57 PM] jass#7796
paste ur compromised private key / secret words to ur verus wallet login screen.  click light and then KMD.   -- to login to ur compromised wallet.     Paste ur New private key into the login screen in verus wallet  and light and KMD to login to the New wallet associated with that private key.

both servers get no connection. now what?

[12-Jun-19 09:44 PM] IDKsrslyIDK#1330
@Brainzz when you completely log out of the wallet, then try to log back in, one option is to import the seed (old)

[12-Jun-19 09:53 PM] Punk#1349
yea I followed those instructions. It's easy to turn off the proxy. Mine was already off. I guess I'll wait a while. Maybe overloaded.

[12-Jun-19 10:59 PM] Anthony Dear#6068
Hi Emmanuel, I've just downloaded the Utrum wallet, how do I transfere my  KMD into it when I can't open my agama wallet

[12-Jun-19 11:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Deleted User maybe he don't have KMD on old  address 😃

[12-Jun-19 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000

@Anthony Dear

[13-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Punk#1349
HERE'S WHAT WORKED BEST FOR ME. After struggling with the instructions and thinking I was an idiot because no server would work, I downloaded the Utrum wallet (thanks to @Deleted User ), entered my compromised seed, and my KMD was there. I immediately transferred to Ledger until this mess gets fixed. The servers being down adds to the complexity of the problem.

I'm beginning to think that wallets are almost as risky as storing on an exchange. The exception is hard wallets. The little dab of money I'm making from interest by keeping funds on different wallets is not worth the risk for me. Perhaps I'll gain more trust down road.

[13-Jun-19 12:25 AM] Punk#1349
@Deleted User Thanks, I'll check that out.

invalid pub address would mean that the destination address is no good

[13-Jun-19 07:54 AM] Malti#3948
the first error, I also had it and still managed to send, so i guess you can ignore it 😃

[13-Jun-19 08:28 AM] KomaSteve#4705

Hi guys. I made a claim for 373 KMD two days ago for KMD address RH5ZAH8r47VGsfQ5UBGY4WmYTYYJCL91vZ and sent the dust to the destination address mentioned in the claim. Sofar this claim was not processed. Any idea what went wrong here?

[13-Jun-19 09:03 AM] REKT Queen#6380
How long before I will here from someone about my kmd ?

[13-Jun-19 09:05 AM] REKT Queen#6380
My wallet broke 3 days ish before the sweep! I had been in contact with support was advised to claim .. my seed was broken and never worked ?  I can prove that I purchased all the kmd and all sent to same address is there someone that can assist me

[13-Jun-19 09:07 AM] REKT Queen#6380

[13-Jun-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810

I filled a form to make a claim for the VRSC that seem to have been transferred to the safe wallet, but there is no VRSC dust in the wallet that I could send to my new address. Did I get anything wrong?

[13-Jun-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i havent had a chance to send the smartdust for VRSC yet

[13-Jun-19 09:57 AM] haerry13#0044
Ok, thank you for the prompt reply. I will wait

[13-Jun-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also HUSH and BTC that is not yet done

[13-Jun-19 10:54 AM] Lennart#9331
I have sent the smartdust of DEX but haven't received my DEX yet. I can wait patiently no problem, just want to know it there's anything more needed from my side

[13-Jun-19 10:55 AM] Mjalnirme59#1848
I've submitted a claim but I'm slightly confused in regards to the smartdust. My compromised KMD wallet was on my agama app and now I only get a blank screen when I open it. How will I check for the smartdust? Is there another way to access that wallet

[13-Jun-19 11:03 AM] Lennart#9331
what Agama version?

[13-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Lennart#9331
make sure to not use Agama version 0.3.6 anymore

[13-Jun-19 11:05 AM] Lennart#9331
instead, use the newest Verus Agama -> safe to use

[13-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Lennart assets arent being processed yet

[13-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
only kmd thusfar

[13-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Lennart#9331
thx

[13-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Mjalnirme59 use the verus agama

[13-Jun-19 11:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
not old komodo agama 0.3.6, will not work anymore

[13-Jun-19 11:27 AM] KomaSteve#4705
@jl777c 
I have filled in the form for jumblr shortly after the kmd form and given the new address, but unfortunately can not see anything in the jumblr explorer. could you possibly check this or do you have an idea? thank you in advance

[13-Jun-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Jun-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
@KomaSteve everything looks good, but i have not processed any JUMBLR refunds yet

[13-Jun-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
