clear your cached maybe?

[05-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Regnar#6164
Using Brave haha

[05-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Regnar#6164
Got to figure out how to do that again.

[05-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Regnar#6164
I also tried in Firefox and chrome. same results

[05-Aug-18 02:08 PM] Regnar#6164
Changed VPN, no luck. hmm

[05-Aug-18 02:09 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
just downloaded brave, first time using, pretty cool

[05-Aug-18 02:09 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
it's working fine on my end

[05-Aug-18 02:10 PM] Regnar#6164
hmm I'll have to mess around with it then

[05-Aug-18 02:11 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
try using TOR browser

[05-Aug-18 02:11 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
pretty sure twitter won't ban your ip

[05-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Regnar#6164
holy crap it worked haha

[05-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Regnar#6164
I opened a tor tab in Brave

[05-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Regnar#6164
which btw is an AWESOME feature

{Reactions}
👍 

[05-Aug-18 02:12 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
so the ip might be banned by twitter? interesting

[05-Aug-18 02:13 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
i didn't realize brave has a built in tor, super cool

[05-Aug-18 02:16 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I really really like Brave. They have built in Tor tabs, and I like that the tabs are separate from one another, so a private tab, or tor tab doesn't require a new window

[05-Aug-18 02:17 PM] Regnar#6164
make sure you activate the BAT payments, they'll hook your wallet up with some BAT and you use it to pay websites for visiting, decide how much you want to pay per month to avoid all the ads (or not pay lol)

[05-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Regnar#6164
But I'll be paying because I want to support Brave and BAT and make an incentive for sites to stop shitty ads

[05-Aug-18 02:18 PM] Gordon Komodo#7477
will check it out. 👌

[05-Aug-18 02:58 PM] criptobear#6402
hello guys, i was thinking about ways to make public aware of komodo power, maybe a double or triple interview done to people (recognised by public audience already) that represent other tokens similar to komodo like ethereum and then put them together on the screen so it will look like they answered at the same questions in the same moment, the questions would be about TPS, scaling, notarization, consensus et cetera all about putting a nice light on komodo's characteristics. what you guys think?

[05-Aug-18 03:58 PM] okthen#8167
@criptobear I think that's a little manipulative while KMD really doesn't need anything like that. A clear and precise outline of what it is that KMD exactly does or wants to do is more helpful IMO. The more precise, the better. If you want to highlight everything it can do, it becomes a little overwhelming and detracts from the appeal, imo it would be better to concentrate on 3 or 4 core points where it excels and outshines others. Besides this effort it can always be helpful to explain in detail every feature (separately), just not everything in one go. Just my 2 cents.

[05-Aug-18 04:51 PM] Regnar#6164
@benohanlon @Steve Lee  I'm not sure if I'm missing it, but we need to include an ethical or professional code of conduct as a project on our website or white paper. I understand the white paper is more about how Komodo and it's features works rather than a "marketing white paper" so I think it wouldn't belong there. But it definitely needs to be somewhere on the website and if it is already, it needs to be easily available/found.

[05-Aug-18 09:40 PM] Regnar#6164
Throwing some friendly shade towards some instant swap sites that don't have KMD listed 😛

We should really spam him to get him to get to know kmd

[05-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Cryptoon#3362
he's clueless about our atomic swaps and cross ledger stuff

[05-Aug-18 09:45 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thinks is still ages away before it will be implemented by any project

[05-Aug-18 09:46 PM] Regnar#6164
Doesn't someone on our team know him?

[05-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Regnar#6164
Maybe we just include a tag of him in every Komodo post, especially about Atomic Swaps 😛

[05-Aug-18 09:52 PM] Regnar#6164
and If he posts anything about it on his twitter we can just post links to his twitter, and have the community like them

Okay here we are, this link to the time in the video someone asks about Interop and Atomic Swaps. Jackson definitely seems skeptical about this, so maybe it would be a great thing to reach out in friendly way and ask if he is interested in seeing how we perform atomic swaps, or are working on interop @Steve Lee @benohanlon

There is a public marketing board in the channel description if you want to put suggestions on there.

Has the Komodo team thought about using targetted fb ads to gain more audience?

[06-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just saw another coin refereum with 113k likes on a post, and we all know the more likes, the more people see it, trust it and become interested 😛

[06-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Fb ads are pretty cheap. I ran 2 pages and got around 15,000 active followers in a month or 2

[06-Aug-18 03:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
and it was well under a few thousand in advertisement costs

[06-Aug-18 03:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
still get messages up to this day from those people LMAO.

[06-Aug-18 03:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
May be something you'd want to look into? Maybe not idk 😛 But my ads were targetted very specifically, and with minimal followers/likes so prices were high and even so they were cheap compared to other methods

[06-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes social media campaigns are on the roadmap.

For the community news site, what categories do you think will help?
 - ecosystem (kmd and related blockchains announcements)
 - service providers & exchanges (like chain makers, chainzilla, digitalprice etc.)
 - development/tech
 - other crypto news (competitions running e.g. for listing)
 - social media news

The beta site is up on the server it will run on.  Have a few things to test before public show

[06-Aug-18 03:35 AM] Mylo#8306
- community opinions

[06-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Development/tech 
Ecosystem
Social Media news
Service providers and exchanges
Other crypto news

That would be the order I think from most to least important

[06-Aug-18 03:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
competitions/listings would be good, but I'm guessing most people will see those and vote from our discord/reddit more so than on a community news site

[06-Aug-18 01:09 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Does the website contain the most recent version of the roadmap?

[06-Aug-18 02:13 PM] yorklab#7270

[06-Aug-18 04:21 PM] Regnar#6164
It looks like its "the SEC" but doesn't seem to have the same background seal as the other .Gov pages

[06-Aug-18 04:57 PM] yorklab#7270

Any eta on testing to the public push?  Just was reviewing the roadmap and said that whole process would be completed by Q2 2018 which were a little over a month beyond now

[06-Aug-18 07:23 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
actually it doesn't seem a lot of delay, usually it's normal that such things take a lot longer

Rebrand 2.0 is currently exiting discovery phase with our new agency partner Ideas By Nature. Current website is 1.5, but we're working incorporating a few updates to introduce 2.0 messaging and details while we wait for the full 2.0 rebrand.

There's 3 main writers in the news section.
NEO public/community ecosystem is a little more developed than KMD, and those 3 writers pretty much pump out a story per day.

[06-Aug-18 11:58 PM] Steve Lee#1967
they have a network of community writers as well

everyone I'm going to create a place on Discourse for ideas and suggestions we can better review them and give them the attention they deserve. @Steve Lee and our team were discussing this yesterday. 
- also we'll have medium writers for anyone who wants to contribute written content - if it's good we'll approve it and if it performs well we'll reward it
- as a team we can review suggestions / ideas much better via the forum in our marcomms meetings rather than Discord chat

Hello @@Steve Lee, @@benohanlon  , could we get an compilation of Marketing pictures of KMD (maybe on the Main Homepage) which is always up to date? 

I ask, because my english is not realy good (maybe like Others on the kmd forum) , but I believe in KMD and would like to help more to bring the Word out. 

The votings on Twitter (or other Plattform)... Where you can vote for Different coins (like: which is the Best Plattform for ICO: ETH, KMD,... vote now) , are in my opinion important and cheap marketing... And the Best : the community of kmd, who cant speak/write well english (like me) , could post the pictures about KMD too, because we cant make any failures by writing :) 

I think many people are feared about make writing mistakes... But with pictures... Could be easyier... And the voter from other Plattform see the Posted Marketing pictures too. 

Maybe you can tie this with a reward System... Everyone who Post Marketing pic by votings get... xxx ammount of kmd?

Maybe you have some more ideas for people who dont speak english well but would like to bring the Word out?

We just discussed last week that we will use some platform to host alll pictures/infographics about Komodo, so that should be coming soon.

On the longer term we are looking to build a comprehensive 'press kit' that contains information about Komodo so that it's easier to write about what Komodo is and what problems we solve. We are still focused on working out that base story for 2.0, but it's looking quite good at the moment.

We have those 5 blockchain pillars we have been talking about, and we are now considering to move towards describing Komodo as an architecture solutions provider.

We have worked our a website wireframe that contains this new messaging. I'll share with you guys shortly so we get your thoughts.
