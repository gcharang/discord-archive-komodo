I'd like to restate my recommendation that Komodo add a legal/compliance page to the website, as well as Antara Composer.

This should include access to the legal documentation stating KMD is not a security (Howey Test), and also an explanation (preferably by legal professional), as well as linking Money Transmitter regulations, stating that AtomicDEX does not fall into Money Transmitter category.

These are important for comforting investors of KMD to make sure they can stay compliant if need be, as well as opening up KMD to others. It also gives gives businesses or other projects comfort to build on Atomicdex.


Based on the information here.

Market Maker 2: The Engine That Powers The AtomicDEX Protocol
Market Maker 2 is the name of the networking layer of Komodo's atomic swap protocol. It connects peers and enables decentralized order matching.

Adding your request to our website changes board @Regnar ...In the past, we've only shared the Howey memo privately to firms/orgs asking for it. We've already planned on adding legal language in the next major atomicDEX website refresh, but we'll also discuss internally on if this should be added to our main page as well.

I would assume most people who visit the site won't bother browsing the legal section, but those who are looking for it will appreciate it. The reality is Komodo is one of thousands of crypto projects and having information easily available that a company/business/project would ask for saves them the effort of having to reach out to ask for something that might not even exist.

[17-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Regnar#6164
A business browsing hundreds of crypto project websites isn't going to reach out to each of them and ask for something most of them won't even have. This may be more in line with giving them something they didn't know they wanted

[17-Oct-19 07:40 AM] Audo#5667
the task is now on the website to do list, but it's a long list of things, so might take some time until it appears on the website

Read an interesting article about the scalability issue of public Blockchains, how Ethereum is becoming increasingly centralised as more and more nodes are unable to sync due to network demands, and why this will force Ethereum to increase blocksize cap which will raise fees and eventually prevent DApps from functioning. Was curious to understand if this is an issue that Komodo may face in the future and if so, how would one mitigate the risk? https://hackernoon.com/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-has-exceeded-1tb-and-yes-its-an-issue-2b650b5f4f62

[20-Oct-19 12:21 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe the core concept of having a multi-chain ecosystem completely negates this from being a factor. Each chain has it's own blockchain and doesn't require the komodo chain to do anything.

[20-Oct-19 01:06 PM] Matthias#2174
Ok so nothing is built on the Komodo chain itself?

[20-Oct-19 01:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Matthias Whatever is built on Komodo main blockchain is adoptable by the Antara Smartchains.
If you for example start your own project using Komodo tech, instead of creating a token on top of KMD's main chain unlike Ethereum's ERC20 tokens, you are actually using the Komodo's daemon `komodod` to start your very own blockchain with few blockchain parameters including it's name, supply, consensus and many other configurable params, which gives you full control on it.

[20-Oct-19 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to get started, I'd recommend to go through this link: https://developers.komodoplatform.com

[20-Oct-19 01:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/introduction-to-smart-chain-documentation.html

[20-Oct-19 01:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Since you have your own independent blockchain you don't even get scalability issue unless your own project hits it's peak block size limit

[20-Oct-19 01:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and even if you hit that, there is then scalability solution which lets you make a cluster of your very own project's blockchain.

[20-Oct-19 01:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
this cluster of your own blockchain gives your unlimited scalability option

[20-Oct-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`Ok so nothing is built on the Komodo chain itself?`
I can imagine that someday there will be stuff other than notarizations, but as pointed out above there's no need to ever carry as much data as Ethereum does per block

[24-Oct-19 10:25 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's a rather odd document heavy selection of repos, but reads well

[24-Oct-19 12:42 PM] Regnar#6164
I think it would be a good idea to have an ecosystem github list where people who are independently developing Komodo capabilities can voluntarily list their github repos. This could account for when people fork branches to work on them themselves before merging back, or those branches that don't ever get merged into Komodo but are still part of the development ecosystem. For example I have some Python repos for an nSPV wallet, some RPC wrappers, and TokensCC APIs and projects on my github which are Komodo specific but aren't considered in the development ecosystem by a lot of metrics.

Not sure what this "list" would look like structure wise

[24-Oct-19 12:47 PM] Regnar#6164
There was a komodo wiki on github that was like this but I'm having trouble finding it.

Yea I thought it would be a good idea to try and get a better understanding of the entire Komodo development ecosystem. While I don't consider myself a dev, I do work on some things specifically for Komodo in Python, and things like that should show true activity within Komodo.

Dudes- let me just throw out this here:
https://crypto1xbit.com/en/information/contacts/
just a suggestion- 
https://crypto1xbit.com/en/
seems like a new generation crypto casino, maybe they could be interested in using KMD platform tech?
very much screams BET and CHIPS at me...
last time I checked online casinos for crypto use, nothing like this was on the market, like 3 years ago or so,  BTC usage looked mostly like a grudging and sloppy add-on, but these guys seem to have fully embraced crypto
ofc all centralized and all that- but that is status of industry now
so if they are really innovative and proactive, maybe they see the advantage of a truly decentralized casino platform and start looking at KMD platform tech and maybe implement it ?
How about just reaching out to them and try to start a conversation with them?
KMD has the tech, but not the capabilities to be an online casino (like creating GUIs etc)

ofc a business has to earn money, and online casinos that provide poker tables want to rake the fees, but that business model still works with decentralized solutions, so if they are really innovative and understand decentrlaized tech they will appreciate this fact

"For instance, if you want to trade a OmiseGo (OMG, an ERC-20 token) with Monero (XMR, a privacy coin with its own unique protocol), you would need to trade from OMG to ETH and then from ETH to XMR. It wouldn’t be possible to trade directly from OMG to XMR"

IMHO this may not be the best example to use as XMR isn't supported on AtomicDEX yet? From the recent decentralised exchange article

[29-Oct-19 09:07 PM] Cabey#3299
Especially when this is mentioned shortly after "For a truly decentralized exchange, all of the challenges described above are overcome"

then that should be the reason used, not 'repeating complaints atomicdex everywhere'
My point is that mods need to be mindful of not only what is going on, but the outside result that it can have
