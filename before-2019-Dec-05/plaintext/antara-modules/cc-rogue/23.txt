sometime i had to enter the last command twice to get the run cc line

[15-Feb-19 12:25 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
register?

[15-Feb-19 12:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
oh it was step i mention

[15-Feb-19 12:25 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
5

[15-Feb-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yes, this is where something is wrong since i only get "slot": 0 in the players section, nothing else

[15-Feb-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
no baton

[15-Feb-19 12:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i guess that is because i have no funds?

[15-Feb-19 12:28 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
not sure whats going on there siu. i know you dont need anyfunds to satrt a level 1 game

[15-Feb-19 12:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
If you get the rogue chain running, you can install the TUi and go from there its alot easier than manually playing

[15-Feb-19 12:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i started from the beginning and now it works

[15-Feb-19 12:31 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
or at least i have a baton*

[15-Feb-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
but i dont get the `gamehash` or the `seed` output with `gameinfo`

[15-Feb-19 12:34 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh, now i got it... strange heheh

[15-Feb-19 12:34 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Hi, Everyone – Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening! Before I ask tons of questions,I should officially introduce myself. I'm Mike O, I've been helping Fishyguts on Pirate for the last few months. I saw the opportunity to work on Rogue yesterday morning, chatted with JL for a bit and will be working on some marketing endeavors. I'll be gathering info and getting together ideas for over the weekend, then rolling out what I can this upcoming week. This will include building a timeline going backward from a tournament event.  Any and all info, insight, and collaboration I can get is very much appreciated. I am excited to help showcase this tech and its value to the gaming and crypto communties!

[15-Feb-19 12:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL to play the bailout games again,  I use the register command using the id from the players command output?

[15-Feb-19 12:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
register command asks for gameid, so that id from games output?

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
If you did bailout you can't continue game - it means you quit it

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
do I just pick any gameid and use any player id with it?

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
The rogue doc is instructions ^ @siu - Chainmakers

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Whoo i farmed 0.45 rogue so far 🤣

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
yeah, i read it but didnt found or didnt undertand what the % was 😬

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
If your player is alive you'll able to re-use him in next game (register accept playertxid as arg)

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh didn't new bailout is quiting 😦

[15-Feb-19 12:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
which one was the command which I could use the resume playing game back again where I left of?

[15-Feb-19 12:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thought bailout was that?

[15-Feb-19 12:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I dont think you can save game progress satinder

[15-Feb-19 12:41 PM] TonyL#3577
You can't continue game - only warrior saving

[15-Feb-19 12:41 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
👆

[15-Feb-19 12:41 PM] TonyL#3577
You can re-use warrior in other game

[15-Feb-19 12:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, when you say warrior it means the players txid output from players command?

[15-Feb-19 12:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep

[15-Feb-19 12:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, so if I need to use those players I just either join existing games or make newgame, correct?

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] TonyL#3577
register accept playertxid as arg

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
i drank a potion and feel stronger

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
15 (16)

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
is that permanent

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or temp

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] TonyL#3577
playertxid is optional argument of register

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, gonna try that arg now....

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
should i be drinking all my str potions like in pixel, or is it temp boost

[15-Feb-19 12:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for clearing 👍

[15-Feb-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
@Crabby Paddy If you have not full strength - poition of gaining strength will restore one point

[15-Feb-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have full strength your max strength will be permanently more for one point

[15-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
ah how does strength come

[15-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or go?

[15-Feb-19 12:44 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so id be wasting my potion

[15-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
drinking it if im not on full strength?

[15-Feb-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
oh my, level 4 😮

[15-Feb-19 12:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Some NPC like a snakes can make you weaker

[15-Feb-19 12:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Snakes with poition

[15-Feb-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just got bit by one

[15-Feb-19 12:45 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
im hungry

[15-Feb-19 12:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL in what cases I use highlander command?

[15-Feb-19 12:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
no worries cleared

[15-Feb-19 12:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
from rpc file

[15-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so if we die do we get anything

[15-Feb-19 12:50 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
or only if we bail outw

[15-Feb-19 12:50 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
was it 50% or something in gold

[15-Feb-19 12:53 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think it converted to 0.0001 rogue per gold on bailout and 0.001 per gold on successful completion of the game?

[15-Feb-19 12:56 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i think i got to a dead end and im dying

[15-Feb-19 12:58 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is it possible to get to a dead end? what should i do then?

[15-Feb-19 01:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL if I get killed in a game, do I have to execute the bailout command?

[15-Feb-19 01:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If it's not removed, you should be able to save your character. You can in the original and other versions from what I have read and played.  Not sure what's been changed though.  I suppose JL knows.

[15-Feb-19 01:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
reading that python link... helpful! 🙂

as I understand this code, it doesn't matter what was the result of the game, a bailout command is executed?

[15-Feb-19 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
encountered H, ran, H all the way behind me, found another H `H@H`, got killed 😂

[15-Feb-19 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's fun! 😹

[15-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Double teamed to death by hobgoblins!

[15-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I usually die when I run, the game just spawns enemies the more you move around. So I just fight.

@TonyL what should I do now, doesn't look like I have anything else remaining there 🤔

[15-Feb-19 01:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that means I'm won? and execute the highlander command?

[15-Feb-19 01:29 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
