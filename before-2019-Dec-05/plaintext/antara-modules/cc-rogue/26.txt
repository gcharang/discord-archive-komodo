One sec brb

[15-Feb-19 07:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i think damage is 1 roll of 8, 1 roll of 8, 3 rolls of 10, so possible to get hit with damage of 46

[15-Feb-19 07:13 PM] SHossain#0007
i learned by playing after jl777 started the development.

[15-Feb-19 07:13 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

Yeah it's hard to make your way even with the DOC.

[15-Feb-19 07:14 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I never heard of rogue before seeing this

[15-Feb-19 07:15 PM] SHossain#0007
same here

[15-Feb-19 07:16 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I only knew of Roguelike as a genre.

[15-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
at the dawn of the modern age, there was rogue

[15-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
which spawned roguelikes

[15-Feb-19 07:20 PM] jl777c#5810
which spawned quite a few modern games

[15-Feb-19 07:21 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I supose thats where zelda games and pokemon came from

[15-Feb-19 07:29 PM] SHossain#0007
rattlesnakes are scary for me

[15-Feb-19 07:29 PM] SHossain#0007
and bats are annoying

probably want to dump the poison and aggravate monsters

[15-Feb-19 07:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Place your bids 😃 Dope rings, proked mace hits good

[15-Feb-19 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that sound a good idea.

[15-Feb-19 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
i forgot

[15-Feb-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder what a realistic price for such a character is

[15-Feb-19 07:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Potion of poison can throw to monsters if I remember correct

[15-Feb-19 07:33 PM] jl777c#5810
2handed sword is the most effective,as long as you are strong enough

[15-Feb-19 07:34 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, that is good to know

[15-Feb-19 07:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Only problem is no food - so probably some grind on low levels will be needed

[15-Feb-19 07:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Until find enough food for long run

[15-Feb-19 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
some levels seem full of food

[15-Feb-19 07:35 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it's totally random - sometimes I have 10 in pack, sometimes a lot of levels without food

[15-Feb-19 07:42 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
you seem to get 0.0003 rogue every time for just dying straightaway

[15-Feb-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
keep dying 😛

[15-Feb-19 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007

im doing pretty well at earning 30k sats lol

[15-Feb-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
@CryptoNinjaa i think there might be a bug with one of the rpc calls that give players free ROGUE for registering

[15-Feb-19 07:44 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
getting gold and bailing is alot better tho

[15-Feb-19 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 1 gold is 0.0005

[15-Feb-19 07:45 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257

cant take it to the afterlife

[15-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
i wonder how many hours of play on average per ROGUE

[15-Feb-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i thought the free rogue dust was by design

[15-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
no

[15-Feb-19 07:46 PM] SHossain#0007
that's why i never reported

[15-Feb-19 07:46 PM] jl777c#5810
which rpc gives the dust, if it is change error, it could end up being giant amount

[15-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504

[15-Feb-19 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
harmless to broadcast a tx onchain

[15-Feb-19 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
now i have a balance of `"balance": 0.00010000,`

[15-Feb-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
all the rogue tx are autobroadcast, doesnt hurt to broadcast again, if it says already in blockchain then it means it is already in the blockchain

[15-Feb-19 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so just newgame got you a txfee...

[15-Feb-19 08:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, I see how this is. it is a fixed 0.0001 per tx. we can consider it a faucet

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[15-Feb-19 08:09 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, this is the reason i didn't report about this dust creation before

[15-Feb-19 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess it allows people to play in multiplayer buyin games

[15-Feb-19 08:10 PM] SHossain#0007
so, this wouldn't let users create giant amount. right?

[15-Feb-19 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see how it would. if you ever see anything bigger than txfee, let me know

[15-Feb-19 08:13 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. of course

[15-Feb-19 08:21 PM] TonyL#3577
After quit dungeon and enter again potions detecting (at least potions have to track other items)

[15-Feb-19 08:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i could preserve the hidden/known attributes of items but if there is to be a market for these characters i figured people would need to see what they were getting. also the attribute it in the playerdata, so advanced users would write decoders and get an advantage over the users that dont

[15-Feb-19 08:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the penalty for bailing out is that you have to start all over again, which becomes a bigger and bigger issue, the deeper you are, so I think it is a good tradeoff, since there doesnt seem to be any obvious point where you can just get any unfair advantage

[15-Feb-19 08:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes have sense, it's not big advantage to know what potion or ring you have if you need to grind tens of levels again

[15-Feb-19 08:26 PM] TonyL#3577

Lost pretty good warrior in this game.
What happened: I've started it on level1 fully surrounded by enemies around 20hp and have to spend move to put armor and weapon. Did few keystrokes in attempt to fight. (I think whole game was around 5 keystrokes) Then 9 hp remained and I've decided to quit.
My warrior didn't back from this dungeon ride...
