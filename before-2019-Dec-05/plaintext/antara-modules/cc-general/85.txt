sure,no problem. We can later work on taking it further.

[29-Aug-18 12:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree

[29-Aug-18 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
i just had an idea of how to use tokens and oracles.

[29-Aug-18 01:00 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
for example a BTC value based token could be done.

[29-Aug-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
people lock 100btc in an address and the token can use oracles to follow btc market value of those tokens based on the price of btc

[29-Aug-18 01:01 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
a decentralized BTC etf or something similar

[29-Aug-18 01:02 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
mutual fund of sorts.

[29-Aug-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i had the similar idea

[29-Aug-18 01:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that way a shorting token could be done too

[29-Aug-18 01:09 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
just create a token to track the inverse value of that other btc fund.

[29-Aug-18 01:13 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
```{
    "result": {
        "result": "success",
        "tokenid": "b2be0097c0c5597501ab1652618f37aa35573acf7fc83eaa993ad1d14147a1fc",
        "owner": "02bc4c43e24873cf223bee487d78605ec631380940713c6779963018ec711f5dde",
        "name": "BTCF",
        "supply": 21000000,
        "description": "Bitcoin Fund, a decentralized Smart contract enforced fund for tracking bitcoin price. This fund will hold X quantity of bitcoin in a locked address. The token generated will track the value of the bitcoins locked in the address using oracle smart contracts to track global average of bitcoin price."
    },
    "error": null,
    "id": null
}```

[29-Aug-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, bitmex can be done, but need the foundational CC in place first

[29-Aug-18 01:20 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
which is the oracle?

[29-Aug-18 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
external data -> blockchain

[29-Aug-18 01:22 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
that is some big milestone

[29-Aug-18 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess with oracles activated the potential value will 10x more than smart contract enabled chain, which is already 10x of current in my views :abusedsmily:

[29-Aug-18 01:26 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
we need a billion dollar investment on KMD.... :p

[29-Aug-18 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
if btc is https and zcash is https then kmd cc contracts are like PHP

[29-Aug-18 01:27 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
is this a correct assertion?

[29-Aug-18 01:33 PM] jorian#4555
btc is silver, zcash is gold then kmd is platinum :p

[29-Aug-18 01:33 PM] jorian#4555
https vs php is not a real comparison :p

cc contracts are not a currency

[29-Aug-18 02:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL can you show me a use of `getspentinfo` from the CLI that works?

[30-Aug-18 03:27 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=AT7 getspentinfo '{"txid": "e343ce51cbc0518651fb101bf0ae09db4e18ce2d5f25c82db1dbde1938fcb561", "index": 0}'```

[30-Aug-18 12:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto 
Just started to write some new tests for reward CC.  I wonder if we have to set some length check for reward plan name?
I saw your implementation for dice:
```#define PLAN_NAME_MAX   8
#define VALID_PLAN_NAME(x)  (strlen(x) <= PLAN_NAME_MAX)```

8 might be to small for this one since there is no description field. Is there some logic which making non reasonable names > 8 chars as in dice plans? (i'm sank in C code lol)

[30-Aug-18 03:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL that VALID_PLAN_NAME should go into a header file where all CC stuff can access it

[30-Aug-18 03:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL plan names are actually constrained to 8 chars, that data is stored in transactions as 1 byte, so it can't be larger

[30-Aug-18 03:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@TonyL and I don't quite understand what you mean by ` Is there some logic which making non reasonable names > 8 chars as in dice plans?`

[30-Aug-18 11:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto It's in rpcwallet.cpp atm but using only for dice plan name validation.
I meant: is 1 byte limitation same for dice and rewards plans names?
Because for token for example there is 32 chars name limitation.

[31-Aug-18 01:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
token names are different than plan names

[31-Aug-18 01:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
plan names, in all CC's, can be at most 8chars, because they are stored as 1 byte in op_return data

[31-Aug-18 01:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
token names can be 32 chars and descriptions 4096 chars

[31-Aug-18 03:25 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto  Thanks, so we have to set limitation for rewards plan as well.

[31-Aug-18 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it is stored in sbits, uint64_t

[31-Aug-18 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@dukeleto I've added same validation for rewards CC (compiled and tested): https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo/commit/bad5d1c3bde49ab14d8436d040020ba340d147b3
If it's ok I'll add it to my next PR with rewards tests

[31-Aug-18 02:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can start writing tests for channel stuff

[31-Aug-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
dont start until all the other CC are done. The rpc calls are still subject to some changes, especially the parameters

[31-Aug-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
that being said, I think having the rpc calls listed allows to start thinking about how to test them

[31-Aug-18 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
also, feel free to ask questions as to what the calls do

[31-Aug-18 02:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c you are right, I should concentrate on the 4 main ones. I have no idea exactly how close to "100% coverage of all 4 main CC rpcs" but my guess is somewhere near 50%

[31-Aug-18 02:57 PM] siu - Chainmakers#3920

implemented oracles CC (without validation yet) and still some bugs, but I have the rpc interface mostly done:
oraclesaddress [pubkey]
oraclescreate name description format
oraclesdata oracletxid hexstr
oraclesinfo oracletxid
oracleslist
oraclesregister oracletxid datafee
oraclessubscribe oracletxid publisher datafee

[02-Sep-18 03:39 PM] jl777c#5810
I ended up using the oracle CC to allow people to create data subscription services

[02-Sep-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can create a new oracle data description, and this txid is used for most of the other rpc calls.
given an oracletxid, a pubkey will register as a data provider with a datafee for each data post. I guess I need to allow a data provider to make a post without payment, so they can develop their own reputation.

[02-Sep-18 03:42 PM] jl777c#5810
given a data provider, anybody can then pay them to provide data for everybody else. this allows the data provider to post data and get paid the datafee per post. Likely this CC can support an entire data sub-economy, but there is no point to point data subscription that is directly supported. However, even this is possible by having the data that is posted being encrypted to the subscriber. in this case, you need to create a different oracletxid per subscriber

[02-Sep-18 03:44 PM] jl777c#5810
this rpc interface is pretty much set, just might change due to bugs found. It will act as a data source for higher level CC, like prices and pegs CC
