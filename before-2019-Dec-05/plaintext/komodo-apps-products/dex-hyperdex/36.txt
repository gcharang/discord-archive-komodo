Can you try going to `Help > Debug Mode`

[08-May-19 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
the app will the restart the developer console open

[08-May-19 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you try and log in again it should log some output to the console

Is the dex running?

[11-May-19 03:40 PM] Bongistan#2965
I am looking at a dex explorer

[11-May-19 03:40 PM] Bongistan#2965
And see 0 transactions for a few days now.

[11-May-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
The transactions are on the respective chains you are trading

[11-May-19 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure what explorer you are looking at

[11-May-19 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
we are transitioning to mm2

[11-May-19 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
mm1 usage would only be by people who are setting things up on their own

[11-May-19 09:08 PM] TomiDCat#6017
Possible to get maybe 1000 kmd on hyperdex right now? Or should I head to a centralized exchange

[12-May-19 06:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@TomiDCat CEX probably

[12-May-19 10:43 AM] Bongistan#2965

It says no transactions in the last 24 houra

[12-May-19 10:43 AM] Bongistan#2965
And it is like this for a few days alrwady.

[12-May-19 10:44 AM] Bongistan#2965
I would like to trade on a kmd powerd dex.. I am interested to trade btc eos kmd and pax usdc tusd

[12-May-19 10:45 AM] Bongistan#2965
This type of exchange should bw possible with kmd easily.

[12-May-19 10:46 AM] Bongistan#2965
To mw the binance dex is not really a dex because it can only be operated by binance. As komodo has all the atomic swap functions I don't see any reason eht komodo should not emerge asnthe biggest dex of all.

[12-May-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ask to get invited for mm2 testing

[12-May-19 10:49 AM] Bongistan#2965
Please invite me

[12-May-19 10:50 AM] Bongistan#2965
Or is there a link?

[12-May-19 10:52 AM] Bongistan#2965
A dex should be running at all times.

[12-May-19 10:52 AM] Bongistan#2965
Similar to. Bitocoin that has 99.99% uptime for 10 years now.

[12-May-19 10:52 AM] Bongistan#2965
If dex is sometimes running and sometimes not

[12-May-19 10:53 AM] Bongistan#2965
Then traders will use other platforms and liquidity will not be there.

[12-May-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
well it is totally up to the users to run active nodes or not and now mm1 is very sparse, all the regular users of mm1 are testing mm2.

[12-May-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@hyperDEX do you know how to invite a new mm2 tester?

[12-May-19 11:04 AM] Bongistan#2965
Is mm2 safe to be used for real trading?

[12-May-19 11:05 AM] Bongistan#2965
Or are there still bugs that might result in disclosure of private keys or loss of coins?

[12-May-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is still being tested and depending on what you do, maybe you can lose coins. that is why it is being tested. so use test funds, no privkeys to valuable addresses

[12-May-19 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
@cipi can you get @Bongistan the info needed to test mm2?

[12-May-19 11:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jl777c  you need to give them a tester role

[12-May-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i am sure other things are needed to, just not sure of all the details

[12-May-19 11:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think @SHossain will know about mm2.0 testing?

[12-May-19 11:49 AM] jorian#4555
@hyperDEX are you guys working on hyperdex and mm2.0's baby?

[12-May-19 11:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would like to @jorian, depends when mm 2.0 is complete and if im working at mcdonalds or not at this rate 😛

[12-May-19 03:22 PM] cipi#4502
@Bongistan mm2 repo is this https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET (README contains build instructions)
and this are the API-calls mm2 supports atm: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomic-swap-dex/dex-api.md
i sent you friend request. i hope that after you accept it, i can invite you to the mm2-channel (doesn't work atm)

Is hyperdex like the next version of BarterDex?

[25-May-19 10:12 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@jacman hyperdex is a client that uses the barterdex platform

[25-May-19 12:01 PM] jacman#4756
I see. Is it in pre-launch phase right now?

[25-May-19 12:05 PM] jacman#4756
And please tell me it works with hardware wallets! 🤞

Hello @hyperDEX   I'm trying to withdraw from HyperDEX   I can't get it to work.   It does ask me to OK the transaction fee, and makes the alert claiming that the withdraw was sucessful, but I don't get a transaction hash nor do funds transfer to my address.

[25-May-19 03:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@NNoperator you can use the same seed or exported wif from hyperDEX in Agama Desktop to access the funds

i didn't know that, i recovered my funds blocked on hyperdex, this environment is awesome! there is nothing better out there

[26-May-19 09:45 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will have a look at what may be wrong.

[27-May-19 03:23 PM] Jcharming#2693
I'm trying learn more about DEX tokens, and their place in the ecosystem/where they came from(issuance) etc.  Can anyone here tell me a little about them or link me towards some literature to find out more?

Thank you for the links and info

[27-May-19 10:44 PM] willofleo#7505
hopefully the rebranding will address these issues such as people having to ask about the role of a specific asset, it should all be on the website hopefully

[28-May-19 04:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
The payout records on the assets' blockexplorer will likely be all the information anyone is gonna need.

@Acura ty for the link 👍

@actionslacks yes and also what the assets represent, especially for new comers

Hi guys. How can I buy BOTS and how do I receive the revenue?

[29-May-19 04:34 PM] Acura#2748
@tese BarterDex, or try to get on barterlly

[29-May-19 09:22 PM] tese#3502
Thx @Acura , Ill give it a try again tomorrow. Last time I tested barterdex was moee than year ago and was a bit confusing

[29-May-19 09:23 PM] tese#3502
Is possible to know what assets produce  more dividends to holders?

[30-May-19 02:18 AM] kremer#4440
impossible to know which will produce more divs, but you can see where divs go and predict which assets will see the most usage

not sure if that is totally up to date, but i don't think substantial changes have been made

[30-May-19 07:08 AM] Acura#2748
@tese actually i prefer to use Barterlly for that

[02-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Hegelian#0018
What is barterlly?

[02-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Hegelian#0018
Affiliated with barterdex?

[02-Jun-19 03:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
no, only the name is similar. the backend is completely different, barterlly is a web based service for otc trades. There's a plan to change it to a p2p app using barterdex tech in the future but this will require some time

[04-Jun-19 07:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@𝕺𝖋𝖋𝖎𝖈𝖎𝖆𝖑𝖎𝖘 𝖗𝖊𝖕𝖗𝖆𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓*™* Yes that is correct

[08-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Hegelian#0018
Where is the barterdex channel?

[08-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Hegelian#0018
Is hyperdex the same thing? Is there any volume? It's not on coinmarketcap anymore

[08-Jun-19 03:13 AM] smk762 -  dracocanis ominator#7640
similar core code, based on mm1. mm2 is being tested and will be released soon in the form of `atomicDEX`. You can get updates from here - https://mailchi.mp/komodoplatform/five-bullet-friday

[13-Jun-19 09:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
We also have plans to integrate mmv2 into HyperDEX depending on how well it performs

[13-Jun-19 07:05 PM] BuzzkillB#1337
@lukechilds thank you for making that docker electrumx

[13-Jun-19 07:05 PM] BuzzkillB#1337
now that we got some servers up, how do we get D atomic swaps back?

[16-Jun-19 01:13 AM] ghost.in.the.dao#7360
Hyperdex, Barterdex, Zaddex ... a bit confused here 😎

mmmmmm pie

[16-Jun-19 05:50 AM] BuzzkillB#1337
which is the main one to use??

[16-Jun-19 07:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@BuzzkillB not too sure about Zaddex, but for hyperDEX and barterDEX we are waiting for the backend to be updated (mm 1.0 to mm2.0 which is nearly done)

@hyperDEX what does denarius need to do to get readded to the dex? quite a few users miss atomic swaps

[17-Jun-19 05:59 AM] Carsen#3333
mm2.0 sounds awesome cant wait

[17-Jun-19 07:28 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@BuzzkillB for now, we are in the starting stages of getting hyperDEX refactored for mm 2.0

[17-Jun-19 07:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will let you know once i have a better idea of when that will be completed then we can talk about adding coins

[19-Jun-19 11:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just waiting on core functionality that needs to get ported from mm 1.0 to mm 2.0 to start working on hyperDEX integration.  We were told probably mid July

[22-Jun-19 09:00 PM] FabØ#8941
´´´ @BuzzkillB not too sure about Zaddex, but for hyperDEX and barterDEX we are waiting for the backend to be updated (mm 1.0 to mm2.0 which is nearly done) ´´´ the v2 of Zaddex.io will integrate the mm2.0 remember the all thing is about having a noncustodial privacy centric exchange

[22-Jun-19 09:01 PM] FabØ#8941

nice looking forward to that

[23-Jun-19 08:54 AM] willofleo#7505
will you need an email address to start , or will it be a pass phrase log in which is more dex like @FabØ

[23-Jun-19 10:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Just a pass phrase that is encrypted and a  password to unlock @willofleo

[23-Jun-19 03:23 PM] willofleo#7505
nice

[25-Jun-19 04:16 PM] CoinKing88#1540
@hyperDEX can you elaborate some more on the mid july update for the hyperdex/barterdex? Will it be a first mm2 version or production ready and what are the improvements over mm1?

[26-Jun-19 07:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@CoinKing88 the focus right now is to get atomicdex working (basically the mobile app), so work on web sockets (way our app communicates with the back end) has not started. Without that we cannot provide updates to the GUI.

The biggest changes is that mm2.0 was built in rust so memory leakage issues were solved and that trades are completing nearly 100% of the time whereas the old mm 1.0 there were issues.

[26-Jun-19 07:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So overall a big UX win.
