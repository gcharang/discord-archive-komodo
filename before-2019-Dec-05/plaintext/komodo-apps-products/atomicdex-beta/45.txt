@Sharifa to trade ETH/ERC20 tokens, you need some ETH in your wallet to pay gas fees

[03-Aug-19 11:01 AM] Sharifa#7849
@gcharang ok thank you.  Didn't know that

[03-Aug-19 11:01 AM] gcharang#6833
as cipi said above
```
in a swap that involves ERC20 tokens both maker and taker need to pay gasfees at different stages of the swap
```

[03-Aug-19 11:04 AM] Sharifa#7849
@gcharang 😱 sorry... didn't check comments above

[03-Aug-19 12:15 PM] JvdP#8992
Not sure whether anyone commented on this yet, but I have mixed feelings about the UI regarding the order book. Let's say I select that I want to sell my 10 KMD. I used to see how much of each coin I could get for my amount, and now it shows how many bids are out there for each coin instead. I have to click on the order book to see what the best bid actually is. That's okay if I know which coin I want to buy (the "serious" use case), but annoying if I just want to play around and maybe see if there's any "dumb" orders out there (the "casual" use case). Any chance we can have both types of information in the interface? E.g. BTC - 3 - best: 0.001 BTC (where 3 is the number of orders out there; maybe put that in a header or something).

[03-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Werxadler#6422
@gcharang meanwhile another swap completed, and one reported timeout, i guess the one with reported timeout cleared all other orders for morty, and the other swap for rick took just too long, even though there was no ongooing swap reported

[03-Aug-19 12:27 PM] gcharang#6833

[03-Aug-19 03:38 PM] Werxadler#6422
Now i created 4 new orders, succesfully order confirmed, don't see them in my orders though, log out and log in doesn't fix the issue

[03-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Spyda96#2780
are there any FAQs for the beta, nevermind found the pins was looking for morty and ricks

[03-Aug-19 04:04 PM] Acura#2748
For all iOS users the new update for AtomicDEX is now available in TestFlight 😉

10 mins for order matching, I wish my screen would not timeout

[03-Aug-19 04:48 PM] 27aume#8635
HI, I get some weird behavior, 
- I've created an order RFOX_KMD
- It got partialy filled, but the created order didnt updated I still see it untouched in order list
- Then I made a taker order with rest of my RFOX balance, the order never appeared in order list but completed and appeared 5min later in trade history.
- At the end now I have no more RFOX and the initial created order is still showing in orderlist untouched

[03-Aug-19 05:03 PM] 27aume#8635
.
Also it looks like Maker orders doesnt close after being filled in UI

[03-Aug-19 05:11 PM] Angelina#6231
@27aume can you DM me logs along with the order IDs, please?

[03-Aug-19 05:12 PM] Spyda96#2780
anyone trading anything other then ricks or morts

[03-Aug-19 05:13 PM] 27aume#8635
yes no prob

[03-Aug-19 05:39 PM] 27aume#8635
I have a little feedback
For created order(maker) I would be good to have some sort of indicator that the order is still broadcasted/active.

At the moment only having it listed in order list leave place to uncertainty and confusion. 
Maybe a little circle loading style
A status code
3little dots loading style 
Something like that.

Make sure balance is in a single utxo otherwise reward will not be growing

One way is to send your entire balance to yourself

@ca333 I have same screen as on screenshot on my side, I wonder this issue clue is not precise message: after `"Click to create an order"` option usage it's better to print something like a "Input amount of BTC you want to get" below the "Receive" section so for user will be clear that "Trade" button will became active after BTC amount input

[04-Aug-19 11:13 AM] 花果山#5224
Only 0.013, no 0.017.

[04-Aug-19 11:17 AM] 花果山#5224
@TonyL   When an order is selected (the current order can be locked, the maximum is selected, the current order should be filled), sometimes the maximum is selected, and it will automatically change to other orders.

[04-Aug-19 11:23 AM] 花果山#5224
I choose the top order 51.12RFOX, and then click the maximum, it will automatically jump to the bottom of the order 0.013.
The current order cannot be locked and the current order is not automatically calculated.

[04-Aug-19 11:25 AM] TonyL#3577
top order with price 51.12 RFOX have maximum volume 4.4 RFOX (~0.086 KMD). There is an issue that base coin amount (KMD in your case) not updating atomatically on trade view

[04-Aug-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder what happened is that only one order which fit 1 KMD volume was this bad price one, but it's bad that swap started without confirmation about price change

[04-Aug-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
@花果山 has you input 1 KMD or used max button?

[04-Aug-19 11:29 AM] 花果山#5224
I entered 1KMD.
But please don't deny that the order will automatically change the problem.

[04-Aug-19 11:32 AM] 花果山#5224
Unable to lock, orders that have been selected will change, you can click the maximum, try.

[04-Aug-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
just tried same case on my side - yes, it's not adjusting KMD max volume for best order (4 RFOX at 51 RFOX/KMD price) which can not fit all base coin volume (1 KMD in our case). But on cofirmation screen it printed `1 KMD to 4 RFOX` (best order which can fit 1 KMD volume)

[04-Aug-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
And after I pressed `Confirm` button swap 1 KMD to 4 RFOX started

[04-Aug-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
So I can't reproduce swap with price different to price on swap confirmation screen

[04-Aug-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Max volume adjusting will be implemented (developers aware of it)

[04-Aug-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Sold 2 KMD for 8 RFOX - somebody should be happy 😃

[04-Aug-19 11:40 AM] 花果山#5224
I lost 1 KMD. it's OK. But in the future, more newcomers will use it, if you can't lock the order you have already selected. There will be more users complaining in the future. Any change at a time is a loss.

[04-Aug-19 11:41 AM] 花果山#5224
I am very afraid that there will be an attack API method, and the exchange price will be changed one second before the confirmation.

[04-Aug-19 11:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you remember what price you saw on confrimation screen?

[04-Aug-19 11:47 AM] 花果山#5224
@TonyL   Two exchanges before and after, only one minute apart, I can't remember.

[04-Aug-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Please doublecheck price on confrimation screen before swap start, if price in swap is different from value on this screen it's very bad bug, but I'm not able to reproduce
