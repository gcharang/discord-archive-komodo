Also another annoying bug:  when logging into the wallet and inputting the password (not the pin) I cannot use the Android's normal paste feature, so I have to type in the long, complex password I'd set

[17-Sep-19 07:15 AM] ca333#0118
everyone we released atomicDEX mobile 0.1.8 (beta) - this version brings many improvements and resolves pretty much all of the reported issues. It is already on playstore (Android) and will be available for iOS (testflight) in the coming 24-48h (pending approval). Happy testing!

**changelog:**

```
fixes:
refactor api provider
initialisation

features:
new mm2
new encryption
sync improvement
add additional logs [debug]
enable biometric only protection

```

Hello, Yesterday I opened an order and after I buy from my order. Maker and taker in same time!! Is this a bug?

[17-Sep-19 07:37 AM] buralux#1776
Any answer? Pls

[17-Sep-19 07:47 AM] wl#4107
I just cleared the storage and start over with my seed and working now

[17-Sep-19 07:47 AM] ca333#0118
@buralux please elaborate on your report. Creating an order and buying from yourself is technically not possible.

[17-Sep-19 07:48 AM] ca333#0118
@dudezmobi our marketing team is releasing details ref. stress test this week.

[17-Sep-19 08:03 AM] Markus#5464
different morty amount on screens

[17-Sep-19 08:04 AM] ca333#0118
and seems sides are flipped

[17-Sep-19 08:04 AM] ca333#0118
amount is okay - it shows the order he was expecting to get for his order matched with a better offer thus spending less coins to get the expected amount...

[17-Sep-19 08:05 AM] Markus#5464
so maybe its not his own order in the end being matched?

[17-Sep-19 08:06 AM] buralux#1776
I checked many times, it’s mine

[17-Sep-19 08:08 AM] buralux#1776
But the good news for 0.1.8 versions the operation fails

{Reactions}

[17-Sep-19 08:09 AM] buralux#1776
On 0.1.7 The operation has passed

[17-Sep-19 08:09 AM] ca333#0118
i just checked @buralux - i thought the screenshot is from the current version - yes in 0.1.8 you should not have this problem anymore

[17-Sep-19 08:10 AM] ca333#0118
this was indeed an issue in the old version with the order visualisation - Thanks for reporting!

[17-Sep-19 08:10 AM] Oszy#5734
is it not showing the exchange rate anymore below the trade button?

[17-Sep-19 08:10 AM] buralux#1776
Ur welcome

[17-Sep-19 08:10 AM] ca333#0118
it actually does @Oszy - which trading pair?

[17-Sep-19 08:10 AM] Oszy#5734
RFOX/KMD

[17-Sep-19 08:11 AM] Oszy#5734
it's ok now

[17-Sep-19 08:11 AM] Oszy#5734
wasn't coming up first

[17-Sep-19 08:12 AM] ca333#0118
ok i see - might be the fetching of the FIAT value - had similar delays (since using external APIs) but shouldn't affect the app like causing an error or so

[17-Sep-19 08:12 AM] Oszy#5734
not coming up for HUSH now

[17-Sep-19 08:13 AM] ca333#0118
We could add a syncing icon for the time it fetches the FIAT values and generates the exchange rate line

[17-Sep-19 08:13 AM] Oszy#5734
looks like the first time it's missing, then second time it's there

[17-Sep-19 08:13 AM] ca333#0118
thanks for the hint - will test this

[17-Sep-19 08:19 AM] Markus#5464
@ca333 from where do atomicdex fetch prices?

[17-Sep-19 08:20 AM] ca333#0118
coinbase and coingecko @Markus

[17-Sep-19 08:57 AM] benzo365#8202
can we put in a request for smaller bitcoin orders, we're supposed to be testing with small amounts yet cannot sell $10 worth of kmd for BTC.. @ca333

[17-Sep-19 09:15 AM] ca333#0118
will check this and revaluate the situation @benzo365 - the main reason for this limit is that with lower amounts the DEX fee could result in a dust-transaction which wouldn't be accepted by (most) network participants. However - we will check this and keep you updated.

[17-Sep-19 09:40 AM] benzo365#8202
@ca333 thanks for the consideration

Have issue when I deactivate code pin. Have black screen and stuck on it ( Samsung note 8 ) . When install again and keep code pin no issue

[17-Sep-19 12:57 PM] Andersen#8337
@vichiet   @wl        Don't deactivate Pin-protection.  I installed everything worked, after I turned off the pin , black  screen and the application was unavailable.  Re-installed - everything is fine.  After each exit from the application you need to reactivate the coins you need. Android.

[17-Sep-19 12:59 PM] wl#4107
@Andersen I deactivated pin and just use fingerprint and it's working fine

[17-Sep-19 12:59 PM] wl#4107
Before I updated I wasn't using neither

[17-Sep-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
@vichiet @Andersen Are you on 0.1.8?

[17-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Andersen#8337
Yes  018

[17-Sep-19 01:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Ohh, just reproduced. Yes, if disable `both` pin and biometric protection app will be not happy

[17-Sep-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
we will fix this issue quickly and release hot-fix patched version shortly

Just a simple UX suggestion: Ethereum network is currently clogged due to high activity. Since AtomicDex tx rely on underlying blockchains, it would be cool to inform users in wallet if there is any slow down on supported blockchains. this could prevent potentional failed swaps and also save time and resources to avoid human interaction.
edit: i just waited >5min to confirm a tx on eth with normal tx fee.

Anyone else on iOS experiencing the wacky Touch ID login? It works but slowly and usually asks 2-3 times

[17-Sep-19 04:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  if it doesn’t get a good read

[17-Sep-19 05:10 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Yeah it’s weird. Doesn’t happen in other apps I have. I didn’t expect Touch ID  performance to be app dependent.
