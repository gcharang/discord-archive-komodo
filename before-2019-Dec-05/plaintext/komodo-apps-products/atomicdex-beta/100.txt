Just 1 swap done, imposible reach 30 and win the bounty

[31-Oct-19 03:25 PM] flequillo1986#5387
I always saw orders but swaps were never completed

[31-Oct-19 03:25 PM] flequillo1986#5387
Most of them never initiated

[31-Oct-19 03:25 PM] tese#3502

We should have a BBQ with beer after this together, releasing the stress. 🍻

[31-Oct-19 03:29 PM] heguli97#5781
i'll try again later, maybe the requirement should be changed to 10 successful swaps to have a change to get the prize?

[31-Oct-19 03:31 PM] ѕℓιм#1031

@boroghor I don’t know. I am trying everything possible, waiting, not waiting, spamming, etc...

[31-Oct-19 03:36 PM] kmdkrazy#8280
Stop trying so hard

[31-Oct-19 03:37 PM] Jaki#9826
Any @Admin here?

[31-Oct-19 03:37 PM] boroghor#4327
@farl haha yeah exactly same. its weird since i was testing out swaps earlier before the test and they were fairly smooth for the most part. multiple successful swaps. but once the test started i've yet to have one pass the 0/3 lol

[31-Oct-19 03:37 PM] Artist#0765
Man I cancelled all

[31-Oct-19 03:38 PM] farl#9964
@Jaki What do you need? I’m a moderator

[31-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Artist#0765
I cancelled all orders

[31-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Hansie#5439
Do you have to keep your phone 'alive' when waiting for a swap to finish?

[31-Oct-19 03:38 PM] Artist#0765
What are the stats

[31-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Artist#0765
Yep it has been running while the phone being locked

[31-Oct-19 03:39 PM] 27aume#8635
I go one by one, pick big volume orders, use 0.05 rick order size and leave a minute pass before leaving the trade screen and check if i can cancel. 
I got to swap successful

[31-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Artist#0765
For almost 2 hours not one order got completed

[31-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Jaki#9826
@farl I have xxx orders but no history? What does it means? Thx

[31-Oct-19 03:39 PM] Hansie#5439
I have more than 30 swaps out there but nothing succeeded yet

[31-Oct-19 03:40 PM] farl#9964
@Jaki We have troubles and fails, that is not a problem. It’s part of the stress test.

[31-Oct-19 03:40 PM] peratt#6611
is only 56 entry on test

[31-Oct-19 03:41 PM] farl#9964
@Hansie The alert before the swap says so. So I guess you have to do that.

[31-Oct-19 03:41 PM] Artist#0765
What is the link? @peratt

[31-Oct-19 03:41 PM] farl#9964
@27aume I try to do the same, but all fails here.

troll_hmm 

[31-Oct-19 03:43 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
+100 tries. Only 2 sucesful. Some trade attempts don't even let me cancel them. They just hang there and disappear after 15-30 minutes and can't be found in history as failed/timeout. 😕

[31-Oct-19 03:43 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
Finally i have one swap with success! One timeout, and several cancelled because stucked on 0/3 😬

[31-Oct-19 03:43 PM] derons#8104
Failing hard on confirmations. 20+ attempts

[31-Oct-19 03:43 PM] derons#8104

[31-Oct-19 03:44 PM] Jaki#9826
@farl is there any difference when you create new swap (select new numbers) and when you select on of xx receiving orders that are displayed? On the second type there is 0/3 note after complete the order? What does 0/3 mean? Thx

[31-Oct-19 03:44 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
mine don't show on there

[31-Oct-19 03:44 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
on leaderboard site

[31-Oct-19 03:45 PM] peratt#6611
Will be event test again ?

[31-Oct-19 03:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@Jaki 0/3 means that order not matching. There is a problem with ordermatching because of the stress on the DEX network this stress-test producing

[31-Oct-19 03:45 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
what happened? Suddenly 4 out 5 orders in my list go to 1/3 order matched.

[31-Oct-19 03:45 PM] 27aume#8635
@farl it not working every time i at like 2/400 tries

[31-Oct-19 03:46 PM] farl#9964
@Jaki I am a Discord moderator not a developer, of Atomicdex. You can choose an existing order or create a new one.

[31-Oct-19 03:46 PM] Jaki#9826
@Patrick Friggens where did you see that the order was successful? Thx

[31-Oct-19 03:47 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
history tab

[31-Oct-19 03:47 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@NWhiskeyTango Wait a bit to see it on leaderboards, if it not shows soon, contact smk762.

[31-Oct-19 03:47 PM] NWhiskeyTango#5590
kk ty

[31-Oct-19 03:47 PM] farl#9964
@Jaki 0/3 is the progress, you need 3/3 and you have a swap 🥳

[31-Oct-19 03:47 PM] farl#9964
Only 2 orders in my orderbook

[31-Oct-19 03:48 PM] Booster99x#7054
@Sir Seven I see that addresses shown on leaderboard haven't the same format as mine when I press the "Receive" button. Why do they start with "b" and mine with "RJ" ?

[31-Oct-19 03:48 PM] farl#9964
@27aume i tried hundreds times and also nothing, but we are helping Komodo with this stress test. ✌🏻

Me too.. but no way ...0 swap  @farl

[31-Oct-19 03:49 PM] Jaki#9826
@TonyL what is the difference between order with cancel button and order without cancel button? Thx

[31-Oct-19 03:50 PM] farl#9964
@Patrick Friggens What is your secret sauce?

[31-Oct-19 03:50 PM] Booster99x#7054
I used to have "b...." addresses with exactly the same link as yours, and now it works

[31-Oct-19 03:50 PM] veldahar#1444
0/100 swaps :(

[31-Oct-19 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
@Jaki In order with cancel button you're acting as `maker` otherwords waiting until somebody fill your selling order

[31-Oct-19 03:51 PM] Patrick Friggens#2418
2/6 succesful. 👌

[31-Oct-19 03:51 PM] farl#9964

I've made around 50 orders, half s makers, half as taker, but none is gone thru

[31-Oct-19 03:53 PM] wookie#7663
I had 2 swaps go through before start time. Since then I have tried numerous times, 1 order at a time, from the order book, I've been trying a few times an hour, but not a single one has gone through.

[31-Oct-19 03:54 PM] tese#3502
Ive got 10 swaps completed in the history tab but I dont appear in the leaderboard, any exolanation?

[31-Oct-19 03:54 PM] TonyL#3577

[31-Oct-19 03:54 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@tese If it will not show up in a few minutes - contact smk762.
