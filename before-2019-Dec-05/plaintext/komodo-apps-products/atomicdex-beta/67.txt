@allbits Then how come ETH and BAT are no longer available? When I open the app and it loads what coins I have added, it quickly says “Sorry, ETH not available”. BAT is also not showing up. I do see USDC as an available ERC-20 token, though I don’t have that enabled.

I really like AtomicDEX and its potential.  Are there plans to allow offers to specify a minimum as well as a floating price based on a rate from an exchange?  For instance, I'd like to sell some BTC at 10% over spot and don't want to come back and update the price every hour.  Also, a minimum purchase amount would be nice as the little stuff just isn't worth dealing with.

Thank you for the cool app!

i opened an issue regarding `minvolume` some times ago and hope it will be added: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/473
atm, there is a fixed minvolume deep in the code, which helps avoiding $1-trades with BTC and paying $1 txfees for those... it helps a lot
to set and update prices i use my own script: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools

Please use legacy BTC address (starting from 1) as recipient. SegWit addresses not supporting by the protocol at the moment

[19-Sep-19 07:04 AM] tarff#4070
Ahh that did it. Cheers.

[19-Sep-19 10:47 AM] wl#4107
Are there plans to notify us (when we're off the app) when a transaction is complete/failed, when we receive some coins etc?

[19-Sep-19 10:50 AM] wl#4107
Another thing is, when I send kmd to the wallet and there are already kmd there with reward available, what happens? I'll have separate rewards or do I have to send all to myself?

[19-Sep-19 11:25 AM] Regnar#6164
@wl rewards are based on UTXO, so if you sent 10 KMD to the wallet it would gain rewards, if you then sent another 5 to the wallet, it would still only gain rewards on the 10, because the 5 is a separate Utxo and is less than the 10 KMD minimum. If you then claim the rewards, it will send the entire balance to yourself, so you'll have a single UTXO of 15, which will all gain rewards

[19-Sep-19 11:26 AM] wl#4107
@Regnar Great, than you!

[19-Sep-19 11:27 AM] Regnar#6164
In the same way, if you send two transactions of 10 KMD each, they will both gain rewards

[19-Sep-19 03:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you using mixed case ETH address as recepient?

```Q: Why am I getting "invalid address error" message on ETH transaction broadcast attempt?

A: AtomicDEX uses ETH checksum verification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55. Thus, address input is case-sensitive.``` (https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030788-atomicdex-faq)

@wl How long since it's failed? If it's fresh one - please wait a little bit, it should refund automatically in a few hours. Also please DM me UUID - I'll check the reason of fail

@IamTrader Are you using SegWit (starting from 3) or legacy address (starting from 1) ? 
If it's legacy one (SegWit not supported by protocol) - could you please DM me the log from your device and OS/device model?

@TonyLyes it is starting in 3

Is ARRR compatible with the atomicdex?

I’ve got VRSC locked in swaps after a timeout trying to do VRSC->KMD

[20-Sep-19 03:07 AM] ia#8418
@PTYX Are there any live examples of web interfaces to AtomicDEX, and a list of URLs where people can do real trades on AtomicDEX. To do that, what exactly do people install in order to starting trading on AtomicDEX? MM2? I was just about to install it, but I also was wondering  if this is doing any real volume of trading, as the first thing I read (in the README.md) was:
```# AtomicDEX Marketmaker V2

This repository contains the `work in progress` code of brand new Marketmaker version built mainly on Rust.  
The current state can be considered as very early alpha.  
**Use with test coins only. You risk to lose your money in case of trying to trade assets with real market cost.**```

[20-Sep-19 03:08 AM] PTYX#6840
The atomicdex is available in mobile app

[20-Sep-19 03:08 AM] PTYX#6840
There is also a desktop application called hyperdex running on the same network

[20-Sep-19 03:09 AM] PTYX#6840
There's not a web interface yet but it's being worked on

[20-Sep-19 03:09 AM] ia#8418
So HyperDEX is a front end while AtomicDEX is the backend?

[20-Sep-19 03:09 AM] PTYX#6840
No, both are frontends for the barterdex network

[20-Sep-19 03:09 AM] PTYX#6840
Hyper dex is a desktop gui and atomicdex is a mobile gui

[20-Sep-19 03:10 AM] ia#8418
How about the Market Maker 2?

[20-Sep-19 03:10 AM] PTYX#6840
The marketmaker2.0 is the engine that let's you broadcast and settle orders into the network

[20-Sep-19 03:11 AM] PTYX#6840
There's another layer called the Liquidity Provider network. They act as a dedicated decentralized network of buy/sell orders for any specific coin pair

[20-Sep-19 03:11 AM] PTYX#6840
You can also broadcast orders from both frontend apps but they wouldn't be considered LP nodes.

[20-Sep-19 03:12 AM] ia#8418
And the atomicDEX-API is simply a reference for anyone building a front end.

[20-Sep-19 03:12 AM] PTYX#6840
Correct

[20-Sep-19 03:14 AM] ia#8418
So HyperDEX is still a current product?

[20-Sep-19 03:16 AM] ia#8418
The atomicDEX-API is the general API for the BarterDEX backend? So it's not particularly exclusive to a mobile wallet?

[20-Sep-19 03:20 AM] ia#8418
Also, I thought I read the terms when I installed AtomicDEX on my Android phone that basically gave commercial, proprietary terms when I got it from the Play Store, but I read in Github normal GNU GPL 2.0.

[20-Sep-19 03:25 AM] ia#8418
Yeah. I just opened it again in my phone. I haven't actually done anything with it yet, but I checked the EULA and it reads like the software is owned by Komodo... don't copy, only one user, all that kind of thing, like a Microsoft licence.

[20-Sep-19 03:30 AM] PTYX#6840
The atomicdex frontend isn't open source. It indeed belongs to Komodo as it should.

[20-Sep-19 03:31 AM] PTYX#6840
Hyperdex is being developed by @hyperDEX. Feel free to ask questions directly to him

[20-Sep-19 03:33 AM] PTYX#6840
The atomicdex mobile app uses the barterdex api and the marketmaker2.0 as far as I understand.

[20-Sep-19 03:45 AM] ia#8418
Just one more thing. So, the (GNU GPL) licence at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX
what does that refer to?
