yes.  marketmaker is server side stuff.

Basic trading UI like AtomicDex  is for the masses

[28-Jun-19 09:06 AM] Mylo#8306
yep.  and it fills orders like a CEX

[28-Jun-19 09:06 AM] Mylo#8306
different to the original mm1/barterdex

[28-Jun-19 09:06 AM] Mylo#8306
we learned from v1 that user friendly is very necessary

@Mylo is there plans to get each coin community involved in running their own market maker?

[28-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Mylo#8306
i brought it up a few months ago for the dex partner structure & incentives relating to partner tiers.   currently at beta stage there are a list of coins, not sure how much involvement into coin communities has bee n solicited.  as in, i'm pretty sure we just want to manage our discord users expectations first, kick those goals, learn from any problems before inviting other communities to join.  at least for the first week or two 😃

if you look at hashicorps partner model, it's why i used for inspiration

this is not quite how the kmd channel will look at launch, but it's something i'd like to see come to fruition as we get from launch to next level.

[28-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Mylo#8306
have a play around in your head how service providers (integration partners) work with coin communities...and how they incentivize etc.
for instance, in my scenario...a coin community that can maintain a market depth of 20 orders vs a coin community that can maintain a market depth of 5 orders for a 30 - 180 day period will likely have some co-develop opportunities or other collaboration....

the collective govt's of the world are the marketing dept for atomic dex. the implications of that are somewhat unsettling. i cant think of any other project preparing a proverbial stick of this size to poke the eye of govt with.

[28-Jun-19 09:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If no one knows about it or uses it, it doesnt matter

[28-Jun-19 09:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That is where the community comes in

[28-Jun-19 09:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
If you are part of any non kmd communities, if you want to be able to freely trade that coin with others, you would let that community know to get in contact. We as the people, have the ability to either take it and get shackled or we can fight for our right to do what we want.

[28-Jun-19 10:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
then hopefully google play bans it for facilitating terror or something completely off the wall. then they lose control and it goes viral.

[28-Jun-19 10:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
i'm anxious to see how much binance alt trading volume actually drops once the ussa ban kicks in. seems like a good gauge of the resolve/resourcefulness of the average us trader.  govt provided market research.

Another thing worth pointing out is that there is virtually no spike in Google searches for the largest cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Bitfinex). But there is a noticeable spike in Google searches for exchanges with predominantly Asian demographics (OKEx and ...
