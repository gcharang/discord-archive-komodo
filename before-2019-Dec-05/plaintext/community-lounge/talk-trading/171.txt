What’s expected to happen with Btc ? I don’t know shitall TA but I see that pattern where the highs and low get smaller and smaller in the triangle thingy

[23-Sep-18 08:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
All I know is something’s gonna happen LOL.

[23-Sep-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
expect the unexpected!

[23-Sep-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you expect the unexpected, then the expected would be expected

Unexpected pump to 100k? :trollface:

[23-Sep-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
as soon as you stop expecting it, it becomes unexpected

Question for the ledger users here. HyperDEX is now developing a ledger reward claiming app. Do people think 5-10% of claimed interest is a reasonable figure?

[23-Sep-18 12:47 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Yassin

[23-Sep-18 12:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It would send full balance (kmd balance + reward minus fee) back to the KMD address it came from. The GUI will setup the tx and you approve all the info on the ledger as you normally go. This cuts down the pain of 2 ledgers or compromising the ledger to send it back to the same device.

[23-Sep-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that’s pretty fair. What’s the advantage of a ledger over the agamas encrypted pin?

[23-Sep-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I’ve got a ledger but never used it and just heard kmd always fkd up or slow to send tx or problems here and there

[23-Sep-18 12:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
So never bothered using it LOL

[23-Sep-18 12:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Basically the key is never exposed to the net

[23-Sep-18 12:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
By using the app, it gets around ledgers issues and you can claim the reward in the time it takes to send a tx.

[23-Sep-18 12:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Instead of having to compromise the privkey of the address you want to claim

[23-Sep-18 12:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Get privkey of address, generate new address on 2nd ledger (or same one), use agama or hyperdex using privkey, claim reward then send to new address - this is the current way

@hyperDEX I would say aim for 4.7-4.8% cumulative rewards to be left for the users

[23-Sep-18 04:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
7.8% is 4.7% left for investors

[23-Sep-18 04:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So you can just market it like: use the hyper ledger app and you can earn 4.75% for claiming monthly your kmd rewards

[23-Sep-18 05:19 PM] tolken#2655
@hyperDEX 5-10 seems reasonable. 5 would be a no brainer for me to use.

[23-Sep-18 07:45 PM] tolken#2655
@LocoMB considering I’m hearing so much hype about weed stocks again, with the same craze as crypto enthusiasts, yea it feels like crypto has been left for dead. Seems like things have finally settled so hopefully this is the beginning of organic growth into worthy crypto projects.

[23-Sep-18 07:53 PM] actionslacks#4072
I think weed business should help crypto adoption. Sadly they still rely on being a cash business and hiring armored trucks to move money around.

Do you think people like vitalik, mcafee (lol) and other people understand kmd tech but choose to purposely ignore it

Sincerely i would opt to think that thwy are busy on their stuff and have not taken the time to grasp the big picture.

`Do you think people like vitalik, mcafee (lol) and other people understand kmd tech but choose to purposely ignore it`
I think people, as a whole, tend to see what they are told is "good" over doing any research to decide what they personally believe is "good". There are any number of reasons that Komodo gets overlooked, ranging from small amount of coders to the age old "fight" of "'no one' has heard of it because 'no one has heard of it'" (the latter being the inverse of "'everyone' is on Farcebook because 'everyone is on Farcebook'"

I gotta admit when people try shill their shitcoins, first thing I think is "wtf is this shitcoin claiming they can do everything LOL"

Would be nice to get him attention to kmd on this tweet

[24-Sep-18 11:55 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
Something like, hey Vit!, take a look at kmd cc, it could help interoperability with all utxo chaina and eth

[24-Sep-18 11:56 AM] siu - Chainmakers#3920
He could help on a eth to kmd conversion using an eth gateway cc

@VitalikButerin do you think this could be a good alternative approach to @ethereum 's way of doing #SmartContracts? @KomodoPlatform has some contracts already working live on their mainnet. Read more from their github:

i dont think CC will be something useful for ETH, but at least for interoperability it would work to connect utxo with eth
