Are you still staking it, @jl777c

[18-Sep-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810

Oh damn, thought you were keeping it around

[18-Sep-18 10:29 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Actually burned it eh

[18-Sep-18 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
I think I burned a millon or so

[18-Sep-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@PHBA2061 I didn't "confound" anything. Perhaps you should do more reading of Ponzi's life than what some random person decided to note in "Wikipedia"...

[18-Sep-18 11:31 AM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
The creation of an intangible object (a "store of value" chain) that serves no purpose other than to sell it for more to the next guy than you paid for it would be right up his alley

[18-Sep-18 11:36 AM] actionslacks#4072
remember all the btcd holders that didn't make the conversion window? well there you go. time to close those support tickets

tfw you arbitrarily eliminate 90% or the supply of a CMC top 100 cryptocurrency, just cause... you can.

[18-Sep-18 12:06 PM] actionslacks#4072
and you're tired of fucking with it

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
is 50% what Komodo team had?

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it ws 90%

[18-Sep-18 12:07 PM] snowdamn#2414
90% burn or 50% burn?

[18-Sep-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810

Is there enough leverage in supernet for iota to issue a jinn assetchain? was that ever actually feasible in the first place?

[18-Sep-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
SN has no jinn

[18-Sep-18 12:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
should show CMC burn tx to change circulating supply

[18-Sep-18 12:12 PM] snowdamn#2414
will pump more after lol

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
sn has iota

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but what does jinn have to do with thing?

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] actionslacks#4072
are they even working on ternary processors?

[18-Sep-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea about jinn

[18-Sep-18 12:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
me neither. nxt ae is dead afaik

[18-Sep-18 12:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
just waxing nostalgic I guess

[18-Sep-18 12:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
they had plans...

[18-Sep-18 12:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
i mean its kind of surreal. You have these Ico's spending millions to up their cmc rankings. and you got cast aside projects and 
past associates making up a large percentage of this ecosystem.

[18-Sep-18 12:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
is it just an open secret? Has intellectual curiosity really atrophied this much?

[18-Sep-18 12:22 PM] actionslacks#4072

i fucking hope so. geez.

[18-Sep-18 12:24 PM] snowdamn#2414
the ones left standing will be adopted due to actual released products

you preaching to the choir @snowdamn  I just keep buying.

[18-Sep-18 12:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
not preaching just expanding on your points

[18-Sep-18 12:26 PM] snowdamn#2414
also, not saying jinn will not deliver

[18-Sep-18 12:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
I guess we are still a relatively small group of people. it felt like a movement was happening for awhile there

[18-Sep-18 12:30 PM] actionslacks#4072
I know @Bryan_Beus  has been doing yeoman's work as far as documenting but no one still really knows the story here it seems

[18-Sep-18 12:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have been summoned...

[18-Sep-18 12:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
yes, just making a point that no one seems to understand the history of this project and how intertwined it is with iota, ardor. btcd, etc

[18-Sep-18 12:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, the history of this community goes pretty deep. I joined about a year ago, and am vaguely familiar with the story, but couldn't write anything super accurate. 

Best is to go to the NXT forum and look through JL's history.

🙃

[18-Sep-18 12:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In short: NXT tried to bottleneck the developers, and JL and company left to start KMD, so that it wouldn't happen again. 

BTCD: A project JL and a few others (ca ?) were involved in, and when they left, they kept their commitment to those folk by giving a swap opportunity.

ARDR: Nothing much in common. ARDR, I believe, is the next iteration of NXT.

[18-Sep-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
ARDR is a half coin

[18-Sep-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
just does the staking part and the rest is split off into IGNIS, which is a 50% taxed airdrop of NXT

[18-Sep-18 12:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah ardor is crap, so is btcd, but its 70 mil marketcap just goes to show what kind of madness is still at play here. I just wanted to say that I am appreciative of the work you put in @Bryan_Beus and am glad you joined the cause.

[18-Sep-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@CHMEX you have contacts at CMC, maybe you can let them know about the RD6 burned BTCD? but there probably isnt even a working explorer...

[18-Sep-18 12:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
I also think a well referenced and linked timeline of projects and subsequent rankings/valuations would be instructional to newcomers and would serve as a boon to the kmd ecosystem in general.

[18-Sep-18 12:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
to compare kmd to some eth token is a true disservice

[18-Sep-18 12:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think we did a blog post on this awhile ago. You'd need to ask @Daniel CP ?

I'm trying to focus on getting documentation into shape, so I wouldn't be able to work on anything else for awhile.

[18-Sep-18 12:44 PM] snowdamn#2414

A bit of history and a basic KMD timeline

[18-Sep-18 12:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
@snowdamn  It kinda already is, but the teeth are well hidden

[18-Sep-18 12:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
And yeah, the marketing team is actually working on a longer piece now about the larger Komodo ecosystem

[18-Sep-18 12:50 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Will focus on all the projects using Komodo's tech and showcase the progress that's being made

[18-Sep-18 12:51 PM] snowdamn#2414
@actionslacks yes, Top 50 will do for now 😃

[18-Sep-18 12:57 PM] actionslacks#4072
The best representation would be a web that fans out to all the projects/assets using the tech and that have had past associations. But yeah, like I said. I'm fine with the shadows and the ignorance of the masses. There was a lot of whining about lack of marketing in the past. Now that's gone, thankfully.

[18-Sep-18 01:05 PM] CHMEX#0686
I asked CMC now to set BTCD as inactive I did not find a working explorer anymore.

[18-Sep-18 01:10 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
I remember buying BTCD at 30k sats right about the same time James announced joining the dev group. The coin double up in only a few hours.

@ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  my citation was taken on the same page as what you've cited on wikipedia.
Besides I was answering to your question why btc is a better store of value relative  to eth or kmd (at least for now), or hyperinflated currencies . I never said it is a good store of value , compared to gold or any traditional store of value.

[18-Sep-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@PHBA2061 I don't recall ever citing wiki for Ponzi, ever
and I must have missed where you were " answering to [my] question why btc is a better store of value relative to eth or kmd", could you please reiterate....
