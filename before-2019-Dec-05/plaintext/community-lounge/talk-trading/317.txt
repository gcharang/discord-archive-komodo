yes and how the west world manage their resources we would need 3 earths to produce this standard for all world population

[28-Nov-18 05:42 PM] blubbi#0643
how could something be endless? if theirs a limit in atoms on earth? :DDD

[28-Nov-18 05:43 PM] blubbi#0643
if one time were able to mine extraterrestic we can talk again about endless

The problem with a lot of resources is that it takes more energy to excavate it than it will ever give

[28-Nov-18 07:16 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I won't argue that point

[28-Nov-18 07:17 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Maybe I should rephrase. The problem is that with current practice, we would expend more energy collecting a lot of the resources on the planet than they would ever give back.

[28-Nov-18 07:18 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Wrong

[28-Nov-18 07:18 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It isn't unlimited

40% of solar output is still very close to unlimited

[28-Nov-18 07:23 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The sun has 'essentially unlimited' energy for us to tap into, but also has a life span.

Kardashev scale
The Kardashev scale is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy a civilization is able to use. It was proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. The scale has three designated categories:

i would imagine any civilization capable of making a dyson sphere would just find new stars to harvest

[28-Nov-18 07:26 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You would hope

[28-Nov-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so it would only be limited by the heat death of the universe

[28-Nov-18 07:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but likely such a civilization would figure out some clever ways to survive

[28-Nov-18 07:30 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
My thoughts on the comment below are that within 10k years, one would expect a civilisation to either die out, or start increasing tiers on the Kardashev scale. Meaning that at some point, all the energy on Earth won't be enough.
```EmmanuelToday at 9:44 AM
No need, man, this planet is limitless for like 10k years.
In 10k years we can talk about limited resources, not today.```

[28-Nov-18 07:31 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I agree that there are plenty of uninhabited places on Earth for people to live. Also, currently, we have enough energy to survive.

[28-Nov-18 07:34 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Are you making the point that compared to back then, the world had enough energy to sustain 10k years until now?
I suppose if we send ourselves back generations of technological and societal advancements. 10k years ago, sharpening a rock into something that would inflict damage was a massive technological advancement. Today, creating blockchain and AI are the equivalent. How much energy has the creation of blockchain used in comparison to sharpening a rock?

[28-Nov-18 07:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I am also using the rock as a guess of what they would have been doing back then. Maybe it was skinning animals, or animal husbandry? I dunno. The comparison still has relevance.

JL, why bother mine asteroids when there is limitless energy on earth? I think that is the point Emmanuel is trying to make

[28-Nov-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i talk about beyond 10k years

[28-Nov-18 07:39 PM] jl777c#5810
for the following few billion

[28-Nov-18 07:49 PM] blubbi#0643
no not limitless, its well defined by the subquantparticals, its a matter of technologic to use these energy

[28-Nov-18 07:49 PM] blubbi#0643
one atom alone could produce more energy the whole world needed the next 100 years

[28-Nov-18 07:50 PM] blubbi#0643
find a way to get that out

[28-Nov-18 07:53 PM] blubbi#0643
u need Triton for cold fusion, very rare on earth , thats the reason why the expeditions to the moon starts again

[28-Nov-18 07:53 PM] blubbi#0643
so even this "limitless" energy source is limited by earth

[28-Nov-18 07:55 PM] blubbi#0643
yes u put Triton and Deuterium together heat it up to 9 Million Kelvin and get 2 Helium atoms out of it

[28-Nov-18 07:56 PM] blubbi#0643
thats the only source cold and warm fusion works, sure u can use some much more rare isotopes....

[28-Nov-18 07:57 PM] blubbi#0643
and?

[28-Nov-18 07:58 PM] blubbi#0643
u need to clean Silicum up to 99,99% and throw some rare metals into to get some N or P electron contucting bands

[28-Nov-18 07:58 PM] blubbi#0643
its the most common element on earth

[28-Nov-18 07:59 PM] blubbi#0643
they dont, but sodium is even more rare than silicium

[28-Nov-18 07:59 PM] blubbi#0643
so whats the point

[28-Nov-18 08:02 PM] blubbi#0643
thery no new technology since 100 years only improvements
