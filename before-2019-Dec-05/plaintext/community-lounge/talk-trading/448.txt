Huobi is adding Komodo. Looks to be free of charge too. If you build a project and actually have results you don't have to pay for listings :X.

I’ll stay up

[01-Mar-19 12:35 AM] yorklab#7270
I would think the volume will be slow at first, but that depends on how much kmd has been deposited I suppose.

[01-Mar-19 01:50 AM] JimD#9272
Now a good time to buy in or have I already missed the boat?

[01-Mar-19 01:51 AM] JimD#9272
We going back to 12 soon right?  KMD the best open source blockchain money can buy and Eth can't shard its way out of its obsolescence

[01-Mar-19 02:09 AM] yorklab#7270
There are various launches to look forward to, so I would say the best is still yet to come.

Swing trading got me in BTC right now.   Can’t decide if I wanna take a 2% gain and buy back in now, to partake in a possible pump or leave my big order where it’s at.  🤔

[01-Mar-19 07:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m up 10% today so I’m torn.
