what is big selling mean?

[18-Oct-18 12:14 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
To some folks $280k is "big money"?

[18-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Vertigo#0439
10k is big money to me lol

[18-Oct-18 12:17 PM] Vertigo#0439
I only have 1.3k Komodos

[18-Oct-18 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
Binance's volume in the time of trex's $280k was over $2M

[18-Oct-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`I only have 1.3k Komodos`
There was a few times in the not too distant past that I had 0, so 1300 isn't a bad start

[18-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Vertigo#0439
Hey Genie do you think is worth it to stake that amount?

[18-Oct-18 12:21 PM] CombatWombat#0279
I got way less then 1k KMD lol but i still got more then 99 percent of people so im rich 😄

[18-Oct-18 12:22 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
It's not really "staking", but that aside, I think every amount is worth taking a "free" 5.1% yearly

[18-Oct-18 12:23 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004

After living in bourgeoisville for awhile I’d probably take a trailer at this point, definitely be cheaper

[18-Oct-18 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
LOL in my 20's I looked at a trailer in a place that looked much worse than that pic I found and they wanted like 2x what I ended up paying for a 3 br house 🤦🏼

[18-Oct-18 02:11 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
@Jaki Can you elaborate on that question? I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.

[18-Oct-18 02:12 PM] Jaki#9826
I got thunderstruck from KMD TipBot.

[18-Oct-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
There's a minimum amount where you need to have more than the tx fees, but other than that, you can withdraw if you choose, or wait until you maybe have more or maybe give to someone else in the future

[18-Oct-18 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
TipBot isn't really "rewards" as much as it is people sharing with others

[18-Oct-18 02:18 PM] Jaki#9826
Where should I do that? In Botchat folder an following KMD TipBot instructions? Thx for help

[18-Oct-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, or you can do a private message with the bot

sideways from 19-20k would make a good base

[18-Oct-18 03:22 PM] Kitchen Table#2858
KMD staying at 20k for a while would be great but you just know that Bitcoin will bust in and do the helicopter to ruin the whole party.

[18-Oct-18 03:25 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Yeah, btc skimming right on the edge of the trend line. looks like it's about to break down.
