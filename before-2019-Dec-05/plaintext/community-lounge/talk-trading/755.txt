There's a lot that will be happening the rest of the year....and many years thereafter.

Sweet. Glad I held it. Bought in at .00045 so Im still down over 50%

[08-Jun-19 10:25 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@Scott checked your address lately?

[08-Jun-19 10:27 PM] Alexfrog#1338
scott dont use new agama version,  please look at the news

[08-Jun-19 10:27 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
@jl777c were there multiple locations that the keys were being sent to?

[08-Jun-19 10:28 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Say mountain man stumbles off the mountain and fires up compromised agama, while the keys will be sent over the airwaves, will they still have an operating attacker destination to land?

[08-Jun-19 10:29 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Or will agama simply not work now since that dependency was gutted?

[08-Jun-19 11:10 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@jorian I dont know what is your problem? The show that was put on by Chainmakers during this incident was very revealing,  I think if you feel so strongly that the team did not do the best that they could have done in this situation, i am not too sure why you are bothering to stick around.

[08-Jun-19 11:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh wait, your project is built on top of jl777 and Komodo teams hard work....

[08-Jun-19 11:21 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So have some conviction, either take this as a learning experience by the team to improve or give up your notary spots and find a new platform that you think is better. You cannot have it both ways.

[08-Jun-19 11:24 PM] PTYX#6840
@Deleted User the malicious code had to be on github right?

This event has been hard on us all,  I don’t think chainmakers is trying to stir the pot just would like to have had more info as it was occurring,  internally a decision had to be made to act quickly in silence ,  let’s just get people to safety , get everything cleaned up and back to progressing.    This event has highlighted things that we need to work on,  such as comms  and will be discussed as how to do it even better if another event should ever happen

[08-Jun-19 11:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I am being purely logical. They have more information now about what happened but @jorian is still acting like a scorned girl friend

[08-Jun-19 11:40 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just scroll up about 100 messages.....

@Hollowman9000  I have not checked it.  All my KMD holdings are on Bittrex.

[09-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Alexfrog#1338
youre fine then scott

[09-Jun-19 12:11 AM] Alexfrog#1338
though, bittrex volume is low compared to binance now

[09-Jun-19 12:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
and there will be 0 volume if you're a new yorker

[09-Jun-19 12:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
bittrex ban, coming to a town near you

[09-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Hollowman9000#3344

[09-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
I didn’t get swept

[09-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Hollowman9000#3344
Got out in the nick of time

Rip ninja

[09-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
So is agama still even functional now?

[09-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
for claiming interest

[09-Jun-19 01:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
like if you've strictly used native the entire time instead of lite

[09-Jun-19 01:44 AM] yorklab#7270
Yes, you can claim reward, just send to yourself.

[09-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Sdunbar#5064
ah ok

[09-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Sdunbar#5064
thanks

[09-Jun-19 02:55 AM] jspook16#3059
@Hollowman9000 I think I made it too. Had to go John Wick 2 and bust my patio up to get my 'safe' keys

[09-Jun-19 04:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@PTYX the evil code was never on Github, it was an npm package. most npm packages have their source code on github, but released versions of npm packages do not need to correlate to code on Github. This is a big reason why you cannot use the next version of a dependency blindly. Every time you upgrade a dependency version, you must read it (and all it's dependencies) to make sure it's not malware.

[09-Jun-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but how to do that if binary and github source dont match?

[09-Jun-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
for thousands of modules??

[09-Jun-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the iguana approach of writing everything from scratch (other than the actual crypto signing and hashing) seems to be needed, regardless of language

[09-Jun-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and for the libs i did use, i imported all the source into my tree, so nothing changes on me

[09-Jun-19 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
many thought i was crazy

[09-Jun-19 04:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
The nodeJS system changes so fast and basic things require so many thousands of sub-dependencies. Nothing is designed to be maintained for years, it's all constantly changing. It's a perfect place for malware, like a busy airport with people from all over the world passing you by in all directions constantly. There is no easy way to see somebody that looks out of place,  it's an immense amount of work. Some people say they like JS enough to want to do that, but no thanks from me.

[09-Jun-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a language independent concept, this usage of libraries

[09-Jun-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, node.js seems to force relying on a massive number of libraries

[09-Jun-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you go out of your way

[09-Jun-19 04:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
and said libraries, if not religously kept current and updated, will break your program, site, etc.

[09-Jun-19 04:51 AM] LocoMB#8593
not sure if python ever had such rampant dependency escalation ... packet structures much flatter and more robust

[09-Jun-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes if you dont update you leave your self open to known exploits

[09-Jun-19 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you update and you can get exploited unless you are extremely diligent, all the time

[09-Jun-19 04:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
it's a hamster wheel. the first troubleshooting step for most is an npm update when something stops working.

[09-Jun-19 04:54 AM] LocoMB#8593
I asked over at the IOTA discord- they paid a specialized outfit beaucoup bucks to do what is apparently called a 'manual audit'

[09-Jun-19 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
which works until they mess up, or hire an employee that is a hacker

[09-Jun-19 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we all need to really increase the level of scrutiny across the board

Any way to make wallet smaller? Mines 9mb is that too big to stake optimally

[09-Jun-19 05:09 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or still fine

[09-Jun-19 05:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
to expect the npm team to detect every exploit being snuck into their platform is wishful thinking.

[09-Jun-19 05:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
you can use ./komodo-cli -ac_name=XXX cleantransactions

[09-Jun-19 05:11 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Won’t mess up my pos64staker, segid, utxo or anything right? @CHMEX

[09-Jun-19 05:11 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Thanks 😁

[09-Jun-19 05:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
no it does not mess with it

[09-Jun-19 05:48 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
another approach is to have multiple wallets to spread risk - but to do it right best if those wallets are even writen in different languages or at least using different modules to lower risk of single malware lib contaminating all wallets

[09-Jun-19 05:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if there was a set of instruction how to use the basic api (komodod or cli?) maybe new wallets / gui would come faster

[09-Jun-19 05:50 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
even I'm thinking I could make one, but I need really easy docs to understand it quickly

[09-Jun-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo rpc calls are based on bitcoin, which has been extensively documented, for years

[09-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm.. question goes like this: i did manage to get my kmd supernet and dex away from swept by jl777 except jumblr and crypto. Will i be able to get them by sending that 0.0001kmd to old address as described?

[09-Jun-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i will use the same method for all the assetchains

[09-Jun-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
just havent had time to process them yet.

[09-Jun-19 05:51 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
most gui devs is not familiar with BTC rpc or anything

[09-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Mark81#4505
Ok thats enough, thanks gor your incredible work James! Very high respect torwards You!

[09-Jun-19 05:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also I would start only if I know how to make lite wallet, which I prefer myself 😃

[09-Jun-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 all the info is there

[09-Jun-19 05:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
gui dev needs very little things to start quickly 1. all info collected in on place 2. few options/steps descirbeid like how ton create new addr, connect , send... + few more and then you go

[09-Jun-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
all the info exists for many years

[09-Jun-19 05:55 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I see the info is the but it is spreaded, first dev need to spen hours to find best source of many docs spreaded on internet

@Crabby Paddy can be "cheated" not to remove the file. don t know for staking but be careful using this too often you will "masquerade" mined / staked utxos : let s talk about this on a tech chan :).
Using cleanwallet won t reduce wallet size, just optim calls

[09-Jun-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
granted there is a decent amount of info, but saying that there are no docs is incorrect. there are plenty of documentations. it isnt like the old days where you had to dig into the source code to even know what was possible

[09-Jun-19 06:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
ok will check it, it's not only about information being there but also the form of it; if you have simple instructions it's faster then learnign the whole bible of BTC -> gui devs come faster

[09-Jun-19 06:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
btw is it possible any way cli allows lite wallets? for me would be easy to use just cli wallet and create gui over it

[09-Jun-19 06:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
but best if cli allows spv

[09-Jun-19 06:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
spv is the future

[09-Jun-19 06:01 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
until there is even better tech

[09-Jun-19 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
use electrumX server docs

[09-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
@CHMEX please don t forget it "erases" utxos from db, for a miner not so cool if not aware of that : not mature funds are not lost after that, just hidden

@Deleted User no luck so far, truncates my seed entry. Tried brand new wallet, Kmd Kmd seeds... multiple times, no go. Tried typing into text editor then copying /paste into seed entry, won’t even paste. Seems like odd GUI glitch (using 0.5.7)  Scanning a QR worked for one of the newly generated addresses, but I don’t have one for my old Kmd Agama seed.

i got the refund processor coded and it will be sending out the first 90 refunds over the next hour or so. about half the claims for less than 777 KMD have properly sent the special tx 2) to the secure refund address. this is approx 10% of the affected users, so not a bad start. assuming there are no issues, the rest can be processed as soon as the proper claims are made with a matching send from the old address to the new secure address.

by the way, the refund processor is 500 lines of C code
