Ya, the long term chart on BTC looks like it could do another massive dump TBH.  I think this is certainly a waiting period for a lot of investors

[03-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
if the narrative is good it could as well be a catalyst for the next leg up though

[03-Oct-19 03:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
but the logical thing would be to exit most volatile markets first 😄

[03-Oct-19 03:57 PM] JimD#9272
Ya, I have it going at low as 7200 but I think the overall channel is upward

[03-Oct-19 03:57 PM] Markus#5464
as long as btc stays above 8k we are fine on a weekly timeframe

Beaxy — Incompetent. In Denial. Insolvent?
Beaxy had a week to prepare to be hacked. They had longer than that, really. Probably long before the idea for the exchange was conceived…

Two hours and four minutes from the first Partial Payment deposit to the last BTC withdrawal. Total take of 43.64253571 BTC and 111,000 XRP, a total USD value of around $570,000 on the day of the hack.

Tragic if true. 

Suprised? I'm not. As soon as I saw Beaxy was working with 50+ broke CT influencers who shilled it non stop, I knew I would never want anything to do with them.

My gut instinct is rarely wrong.

What would be involved to manage Kmd assets on a hardware wallet like Ledger? Seemed like such an ordeal to get claiming working.

#bitcoin fractal dimension (parameter b in a power law function y=a*x^b) indicates we are entering a new phase: orange/red. Although it doesn't feel very orange/bullish at the moment, I am very exited about next 6-12 months 🚀

[04-Oct-19 07:27 AM] Oszy#5734

[04-Oct-19 07:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
CEX =Central Exchange = Binance

[04-Oct-19 07:50 AM] ronyi#5719
Okay... I hold my KMD in Agema wallet and we saw what happend, but we are lucky....

[04-Oct-19 07:52 AM] Oszy#5734
Use Ledger, or native wallet.

[04-Oct-19 07:59 AM] ronyi#5719
I using Ledger Nano more than 2 years, but I think is not user friendly.... always install, uninstall apps and updates. I holding many crypto. Holding VRSC, ARRR, KMD, ZEC, ZEN, BTC, ETC, ETH, STRAT..... very hard to manage in one place (impossible).

[04-Oct-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
You can use some offline device as cold-wallet if you longterm holding

[04-Oct-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Something like a raspberry lets say

[04-Oct-19 08:03 AM] ronyi#5719
Example: How to stake my VRSC in offline wallet?

[04-Oct-19 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Cold wallet doesn't assume staking 🙂

[04-Oct-19 08:04 AM] ronyi#5719
I know yes... 🙂

[04-Oct-19 08:06 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
maybe suggest to miketout to build a lease function, so you can lease your verus to someone else to stake while holding in cold wallet

[04-Oct-19 08:07 AM] ronyi#5719
Someone else? I don't trust myself either. 😄

[04-Oct-19 08:07 AM] Gordon Komodo#7477
heat has a lease function where at the end of leasing , the coins go back to the owner

[04-Oct-19 08:09 AM] Oszy#5734
@ronyi get a nano X holds up to 100 coins and can use with phone

[04-Oct-19 08:10 AM] Oszy#5734
for vrsc run a vps

[04-Oct-19 08:10 AM] ronyi#5719
I stakeing enough VRSC for the daily reward... I using own servers now more than 30 VPS... HA, FT, Replication...

[04-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Oszy#5734
Ginasis Mining has VRCS staking pool, they stake for you and distribute rewards weekly, you can withdraw any time, it's not a website it's run by trusted members

[04-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Oszy#5734
but i'd still run a vps for it 😄

@Oszy do you know if there’s an updated guide to use nano-x on magnum to claim rewards? I did it once successfully a month ago, but seems like something changed on the site.

[04-Oct-19 09:01 AM] Oszy#5734
I haven't used magnum so no idea

[04-Oct-19 10:10 AM] Markus#5464
I can see someone building a smart contract that claim rewards, that would be cool. It would work like this:
1. You deposit your KMD to the contract along with a payout address (if you wish to get claimed kmd payout you can choose to do so or add it to your balance in the contract)
2. The contract return you a secret key that you can use to request a payout of your kmd balance from the contract.

[04-Oct-19 10:29 AM] Oszy#5734
This was discussed a lot before, JL wants people to be active, use the network, not just sit back and get rewarded.
