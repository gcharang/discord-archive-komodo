they are smashing huge amounts of hash power onto KMD

[09-Aug-18 10:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
6k went to this addr

[09-Aug-18 10:25 AM] blackjok3r#3181
and mining large intrest blocks

[09-Aug-18 10:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Unfair that it doesnt go to you? :p

[09-Aug-18 10:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Wonder is that is a whale addr or if hes selling it on an exchange

[09-Aug-18 10:27 AM] blackjok3r#3181
well... yes and no.. .we get a fair amount already, but they can and it seems are, either monitoring the mempool for these transactions then switching hash or its a person, makign the TX then mining the KMD chain to claim their own interest.

I think that makes lots of sense somebody who was it on a ledger or something

💯 

[09-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So hes selling 6k ish on binance

[09-Aug-18 10:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If they are claiming their own intrest it’s only fair, no?

[09-Aug-18 10:29 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think so yes

[09-Aug-18 10:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Risky way of claiming tho, theres always a chance of not mining that block

[09-Aug-18 10:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
Yes, if thats indeed what they are doing, it seems ok with me.

[09-Aug-18 10:47 AM] jansako#3330
Risky way of 'claiming', but once they are past the 1 year, there is no other way to claim... spend a couple of hundred on Nicehash for a good chance of getting the 'lost' interest back.

[09-Aug-18 12:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Yea I'd rather claim my interest safely and not risk losing it to another miner ha

[09-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Is there a way to detect if the hashrate goes x10 and write a script that immediately directs your miners to kmd as well to increase your chances of hitting the megablock?

[09-Aug-18 01:22 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If so, might be something you should look into if you are mining anyway :p

[09-Aug-18 01:23 PM] xRobeSx#5136
code a bot 😃 to switch over, but idk how you know about the megablock coming

[09-Aug-18 01:24 PM] blackjok3r#3181
No that would be impossible... but you can script to detect a megablock is in the mempool and slam your whole farm to KMD bia a stratum switch

[09-Aug-18 01:25 PM] xRobeSx#5136
there definitely used to be pools/miners that would switch over to KMD just for the Free For All mining period, not sure if they still do

[09-Aug-18 01:25 PM] blackjok3r#3181
provided the TX got to youtrnode fast enough you would have just enough time to mine 10 blocks in 1 minute and almost gaurnetee to get it. @xRobeSx  they do, thats why we removed it

[09-Aug-18 01:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I figured that was the reason. I just haven't seen anyone mention it in a bit

[09-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think ffa is already removed?

[09-Aug-18 01:27 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Or is that planned for the 1M block fork?

[09-Aug-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
at 1M

[09-Aug-18 01:28 PM] blackjok3r#3181
if GPU is under 25% notaries just wait longer to submit a block, longer than 60s so that GPU miners have time to find a block

[09-Aug-18 01:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
the z9 miners 😃 ha

[09-Aug-18 01:54 PM] blackjok3r#3181
hahaha... yeah

[09-Aug-18 01:55 PM] blackjok3r#3181
james should do a search replace in the komodod code "GPU" -> "Z9" lol

[09-Aug-18 03:21 PM] c2k#4915
is it still possible to mine KMD effectively with a Nvdia 1070?

[09-Aug-18 03:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not sure, but you could mine on a pool

[09-Aug-18 04:18 PM] jansako#3330
I have a kmd pool as a 'failover' on my 1070 rig, would not call it 'effective', but but you can get at least something if your primary pool goes offline... probably worth more even to point those at nicehash, 😃

then extract it to a folder. Inside that folder create a new text file. Name it `miner.bat`(or anything followed by .bat) and put something like this in it `zm --server stratum.komodo.services --port 3333 --user <PUTYOURKMDADDRESSHERE> --pass x`

[10-Aug-18 01:16 AM] Alright#0419

it will start mining with all your GPUs

[10-Aug-18 01:17 AM] Alright#0419
if you want to choose which GPUs to mine you can add `--dev 0 1 2 3 4` for example and it will mine with the first 5 GPUs

Hi, i am new to this coin. I have 2 questions. Waht is the immature balance and is bpm tool an all in one tool to mine with nvidia and amd at same time? Or do i need 2 miners? Thanks...

[12-Aug-18 04:56 PM] Trystaero#7522
Equihash is dominated by Nvidia cards and Asics. AMD doesnt fare well currently

[12-Aug-18 04:56 PM] Trystaero#7522
BPM is an all in one Miner and monitor that is free to download

[12-Aug-18 04:56 PM] Trystaero#7522
Miner uses the latest forks of the best mining software that is open source.

[12-Aug-18 05:01 PM] MHoApps#2201
@Trystaero  thanks, than i will by KMD my Nvidia Card gives 15 Sol/s and my Amd 290 Sol/s... so it will take years to get some Coins

[12-Aug-18 05:02 PM] xRobeSx#5136
If you mine on a pool you’ll get some coins. The pool finds blocks and then you get a % of what you contributed

[12-Aug-18 05:03 PM] xRobeSx#5136
You’re welcome to use my pool: http://pool.komodo.services. We’ve found 2 blocks in the past 100. @MHoApps

[12-Aug-18 05:04 PM] xRobeSx#5136
And to answer your question above, the immature balance is 100 blocks, so it would stay immature on the pool until then (showing in your balance), and then would be paid out to you.

[13-Aug-18 09:00 AM] MHoApps#2201
@xRobeSx use your pool now....  it is only 400 Sol/s... but... shit happens 😂

I have it on good authority though that both Tencent & Softbank passed, so the article from @coindesk is incorrect. Savvy investors will pass because: 1) illiquid $BCH bags, 2) massive unsold inventory, 3) lost their key chip designer, & 4) failed next gen chips. #BitmainI...

Hi All. If you are interested in Komodo you should check out Veruscoin a friendly fork of Komodo. CPU only with some good pools. http://vrsc.ginasismining.com is where I'm at and the blocks are starting to flow. Currently pool fees are set to 0%.  All welcome!

@bishop It's not a matter of mere semantics, NNs are not just miners and therefore cannot be seen or termed as "VIP miners" as relegating them to a status of "just miners" belittles their importance.
