@p0nd3ea @brucefenton @KomodoPlatform @brucefenton the answer should be yes if you are TRULY about a decentralized system.
Take a look at Pirate.
The first community coin on Komodo.
The transactions on the chain are all private except notary node blocks for dPoW, to ensure...

YAARRRRRR

The Logo contest be wrapping up me hearties... Today @Seko and @webworker01 will make sure everything is on the Imgur link.  If you see your logo missing, please let us know ASAP.  We will begin voting on Tuesday.  It will coincide with the Komodo Infographic contest, so be sure to check those out and get those voted on as well.
Lots of people worked really hard on them!

now something funny is happening, i see all sorts of wrong addresses but with hints to people from this channel

[30-Sep-18 05:02 PM] 0x03#8822
`FishyGuts:z98` as a workername would be such an example, but there are others

[30-Sep-18 05:03 PM] 0x03#8822
while a lot of the others just reconnect using z-addrs as expected

[30-Sep-18 05:16 PM] LocoMB#8593
yay! here is some (not so n00b) Question:
I just built komodod from source, have it running, and I can ask it simple Qs via komodo-cli like getwalletinfo and so on - so far so good.
Now to launch Pirate, I sort of understand I have to do stuff like this:
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &
... ❓ however, is this really the cmd to hook into the existing Pirate ac, or is it the cmd to launch a complete new ac?
reason why I ask is that it still says  '-ac_halving=77777' but that has changed, hasn't it?

[30-Sep-18 05:17 PM] LocoMB#8593
so this is a squeaky clean and blank new komodod running with KMD:
 ./komodo-cli getwalletinfo
{
  "walletversion": 60000,
  "balance": 0.00000000,
  "unconfirmed_balance": 0.00000000,
  "immature_balance": 0.00000000,
  "txcount": 0,
  "keypoololdest": 1538322777,
  "keypoolsize": 101,
  "paytxfee": 0.00000000
}

[30-Sep-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it is changed internally the 77777

[30-Sep-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so externally nothing changes

[30-Sep-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
any change to the accepted command params makes it a new chain

[30-Sep-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
it should print the new halving on startup

[30-Sep-18 05:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
ah ok! so if I want to make a Pirate wallet, I use the cmd as in the sticky on top of this channel?
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &

[30-Sep-18 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Sep-18 05:19 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
yes, use *exactly* what the topic has

hmm .. I have one more question for today:
I have TWO komodod running, one

that does KMD as it looks, and the I have the 
./komodod -ac_name=PIRATE ...
running - now when I use komodo-cli, it seems to talk to the -ac_name=PIRATE because I get Pirate stuff when I do getinfo-
But in general, is it correct to hve one komodod running for each ac, and how do I address queries to specific ones with komodo-cli?

[30-Sep-18 05:42 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_name=COIN

[30-Sep-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
one komodod per chain

[30-Sep-18 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
since each is an independent chain they need their own daemon

right now it's about pirates' honour and trust in keeping that honour

I have not heard of a single incident of OTC trade not honored

[30-Sep-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if a trade goes bad, post here

[30-Sep-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are trading with established community member, then it is simple

[30-Sep-18 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if both are new then would need to use ydx

[30-Sep-18 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems there are some big solo miners now

Can we move some miners over to https://pirate.komodopool.xyz/ ?
The nethash is 98% on one pool.  

Not good at all.

[30-Sep-18 07:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Also, can someone send me the link to setup my own pool?

[30-Sep-18 07:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I am on the small pool.

[30-Sep-18 07:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
That's fine.  Maybe some smaller guys can move off so they don't get their whole rewards eaten up by the big dogs!

[30-Sep-18 07:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085

I misread that web...  I hear ya.

[30-Sep-18 07:14 PM] mountaindrifter#4595
your rewards would be the same (ideally), but I agree more  pools the better

[30-Sep-18 07:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m sorry yeah I misread your statement. Thank you for clarifying.

[30-Sep-18 07:28 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
While I'm among the first to make pleas for added decentralization, I'm curious (other than smaller pool ops looking to equalize incomes) about the sudden echoing of spreading hash.
@mountaindrifter Besides possible downtime loss and the need for valid failovers, what is it that you see as "better" with more pools?

[30-Sep-18 07:31 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If by "us" you mean pool ops, I could agree; otherwise, I fail to make the connection

[30-Sep-18 07:32 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you have 100% of hashrate, you dont have enough hash to find a block in a minute

[30-Sep-18 07:32 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`us being anyone that doesn't command enough hash power to find a block within 1 minute`
Statistically, that's everyone

[30-Sep-18 07:36 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
in terms of pools (discounting for ops incomes) 1 pool and 9999 pools aren't going to change the longterm earnings of any miner, be it solo or in the pool

[30-Sep-18 07:37 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I'm not counting for random luck, I mean in the overall terms of x hash will (on average) find y blocks over z time

[30-Sep-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
so, I'm still not seeing the connection between more/less pools and solo miners

[30-Sep-18 07:39 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
x hash is x hash

[30-Sep-18 07:40 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
nor am I seeing the "hurt"

[30-Sep-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as no pool is over 50% and no solo miner is over 50%

[30-Sep-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems pretty much equivalent

[30-Sep-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but with the big fluctuations happening, it would be better if no pool is close to 50%

[30-Sep-18 07:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is where the "more pools are better" comes from

[30-Sep-18 07:42 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
that makes the "hurt" claim all the more confusing 😛

[30-Sep-18 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
If I purchase the entire 43M available on the 2 main rental sites, how do you see 1 pool or 9999 making any matter?

[30-Sep-18 07:48 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
and that 1% isn't going to change no matter how "thin" it's spread

[30-Sep-18 07:49 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
for clarity, I wouldn't do that because I'd actually make less than I do now, but that's another topic 😛

[30-Sep-18 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
X amount of hashrate will find the same number of blocks, be it on 1 pool or 1000
