with these changes, PIRATE becomes the more secure purely private chain for non-notaries

[23-Sep-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
not a bad combination

[23-Sep-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and its new emission rate will have it end up close to 1:1 vs KMD

[23-Sep-18 08:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes a very good combination and very private. Thanks for the clarifications time to mine some more and start and exchange.

[23-Sep-18 08:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@SHossain do you need any more hash for the test chain? I can throw some your way if it would be beneficial

[23-Sep-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the current price for PIRATE?

[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
WTB

[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] SHossain#0007
last i heard was 0.0035

[23-Sep-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
I will pay 0.005 for large volumes

[23-Sep-18 11:39 AM] Don King#8901
Yes, bullish indeed, the PIRATE armada is heading for blue water!
I think it is likely the community establishes an approx peg with kmd over time, basically two pilots in the same plane, like self fulfilling tech analysis, not much reason for wild swings in kmd:PIRATE rate once things settle down.

[23-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Flexatron#8809
1:1

[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
at 3M diff, what is the approx mining cost?

[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
Somewhere along 0.0035 I think

[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Flexatron#8809
I got bit above 0.001 with 1 M

Kmd/pirate cost

[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
WTB more PIRATE in bulk

[23-Sep-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
0.005 KMD in bulk or 1.2million PIRATE for 1 BTC

@CrisF @xoso and anyone else who want to help with PIRTAE notarization, please use chain and mine. we can't use PRIVATEER due to having 9 chars on the name. iguana seems to support up to 8. `./komodod -ac_name=PRT -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=388885 -ac_private=1 -addnode=94.130.224.11 -gen -genproclimit=1 &`

yeah... there was a small bug for private chains. jl777 is working on a fix

[23-Sep-18 02:59 PM] SHossain#0007
assumed from this

What's the plan for activating sapling eventually?

[23-Sep-18 03:00 PM] SHossain#0007
but, it seems not to be the issue

[23-Sep-18 03:00 PM] Alright#0419
I've seen that error a good bit with staked. Fix each time is to wait for confirmations or send entire balance back to yourself and resplit UTXOs

[23-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
when KMD supports sapling we can plan how to do PIRATE sapling

@grewalsatinder we need to decide about the hardfork as well as @jl777c mentioned yesterday

how can I help?

[23-Sep-18 06:33 PM] CrisF#3405
Awesome!  Great work!!

[23-Sep-18 06:33 PM] SHossain#0007
it is a bit tedious process to get things going. only can be done by official elected notary nodes.

[23-Sep-18 06:34 PM] SHossain#0007
we need to decide the params and update all nodes

[23-Sep-18 06:34 PM] SHossain#0007
jl777 can guide us on the params

[23-Sep-18 06:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I read that halving got 5x ?

[23-Sep-18 06:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I saw the code commits and it was set in there

{Reactions}
☝ 

[23-Sep-18 06:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so I guess same params will still be like 77777 * 5 ?

[23-Sep-18 06:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
388885

[23-Sep-18 06:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if that's correct , if you are using the halving param value 77777 then actually it acts as : 388885

[23-Sep-18 06:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me calculate if that's correct then how the excel sheet looks like

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[23-Sep-18 06:36 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no change needed to the params

[23-Sep-18 06:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it automatically does a 5x for PIRATE only

[23-Sep-18 06:37 PM] SHossain#0007

np mate 🙂

[23-Sep-18 06:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
since the supply of PIRATE and KMD is similar I guess the value of PIRATE being z tx only + BTC equivalent secure kinda doubles it's value.

[23-Sep-18 06:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if getting at 0.005 KMD rate, it's nice rate

[23-Sep-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright I think once sapling is integrated into PIRATE, we can add a rule that converts from old form to transparent. that will create a lot of transparent, but the first time it is used, it needs to go back into sapling mode. the change can be added the same place I added the notary exemption and so when new notaries are added, we can add support for old -> tx, assuming that all new z transactions are sapling

[23-Sep-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
not anything to worry about

[23-Sep-18 08:01 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you like to worry about a rainy day next year and which umbrella you will use

[23-Sep-18 08:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool, thanks for clearing on that logic 🙂 👍

[23-Sep-18 08:10 PM] jl777c#5810
for now we can assume that sapling wont be available for PIRATE until next year's new notary version. and really, taking a minute for the relatively infrequent tx is not any big issue. I guess the mining pool might hit some bottlenecks where there are hundreds of miners... but the payouts can just be batched every 3 hours or whatever is needed to be able to keep up

[23-Sep-18 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
until we get the exchange, I think we can only do OTC trades. current price is bid 0.005 KMD and I havent seen any asks in a while

[23-Sep-18 08:37 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
what about jumbler vs pirate?

[23-Sep-18 08:38 PM] jl777c#5810
PIRATE is not very liquid, but it has the highest privacy level so doing a KMD -> PIRATE -> KMD trades will be very very good privacy
