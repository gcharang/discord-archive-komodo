[30-Aug-18 03:59 PM] Alright#0419
Can you give me an example of how to use arguments for getblocktemplate? @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢

@Alright are you bringing the diff down? 😃

[30-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Alright#0419
wasn't actually trying to, but I will

[30-Aug-18 04:15 PM] Alright#0419
just trying to do weird shit to the coinbases atm

[30-Aug-18 04:17 PM] SHossain#0007
no, don't worry

[30-Aug-18 04:17 PM] SHossain#0007
looks like it is going down

[30-Aug-18 04:17 PM] SHossain#0007
other miners are mining

[30-Aug-18 04:17 PM] Alright#0419
if I see long gaps, I'll mine a block

are pirates using Mini now?

[30-Aug-18 09:52 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm tempted to bring my pirate beast in ☠

[30-Aug-18 10:01 PM] SHossain#0007
how much you have now? :trollface:

[30-Aug-18 10:02 PM] SHossain#0007

[30-Aug-18 10:02 PM] SHossain#0007
don't leave the party yet...

[30-Aug-18 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
i didn't bring beasts in yet as i was waiting for more miners to join. so, there will be a level playing field

[30-Aug-18 10:03 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

[30-Aug-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be nice

[30-Aug-18 10:05 PM] SHossain#0007
small miners can join forces

[30-Aug-18 10:09 PM] SHossain#0007
we need an honest operator

[30-Aug-18 10:10 PM] SHossain#0007
do you want to operate a pool?

[30-Aug-18 10:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
current viewing keys, yes

[30-Aug-18 10:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
next gen viewing keys for Sapling can do both

[30-Aug-18 10:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD has sprout viewkeys, which are incoming-only

[30-Aug-18 10:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
if/when kmd merged zec 2.0, we will get the new ones

I like that PIRATE is lil resistant to pool mining to get started with ☠️ :trollface:

[30-Aug-18 10:19 PM] SHossain#0007
solo pool mining works

[30-Aug-18 10:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Plz keep engaged with BTT ANN to help ppl and point them to Komodo Platform.
BTT ANN is mostly like an advertisement for KMD in my views, showing KMD capabilities.

Wasn’t expecting such PIRATE spirit! 
Aregh Arrgh guys!! ☠️💀😃👍🙏🏼

[30-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm if there is a pool I may fight against minis :)

[30-Aug-18 10:31 PM] Mylo#8306
ha. mining went up 15x overnight

[30-Aug-18 10:34 PM] Mylo#8306
So what is the point of the PIRATE coin?  Is it a test or a serious currency?    what happens when it gets attacked by 200TH of mining to fork it.  it is not being notarized because it cannot.

[30-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
bitcointalk thread should address the questions of seriousness/test.   To me i think it is a test coin.  Nothing too serious.

[30-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
```To play with some community folks made a TEST Assetchain and named it PIRATE. 😅```

[30-Aug-18 10:35 PM] Mylo#8306
settled.  should have read closer.  just in case there are some serious ppl that don't read the ANN properly.   i don't have a bct account.

[30-Aug-18 10:36 PM] Mylo#8306
sorry for being a drama 😃

[30-Aug-18 10:36 PM] Mylo#8306
a drama pirate nonetheless!! arrrr

[30-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Mylo#8306
serious = too much drama.   we don't know what we can't do with it

[30-Aug-18 10:37 PM] Mylo#8306
imo

[30-Aug-18 10:38 PM] Mylo#8306
looks like you want some keep-quiet money so my dramas aren't made into a bigger deal.  what is your z-addr emmanuel so i can shut you up 😛

[30-Aug-18 10:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
i’m on mobile, that’s why I asked to let community handle BTT ANN thread

@Deleted User you really wanna buy?

[30-Aug-18 10:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Like STAKED PIRATE is made for testing purposes

[30-Aug-18 10:42 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

my pirate died after sending 10 tx

[30-Aug-18 11:05 PM] Mylo#8306
maybe i did this `komodo-cli z_getoperationstatus  '[""]'` and it crashed?

[30-Aug-18 11:05 PM] Mylo#8306
to keep that command in history

[30-Aug-18 11:06 PM] Mylo#8306
check your balance, i sent smaller tx to you

[30-Aug-18 11:07 PM] Mylo#8306
ah yeah.   still it's crashed.

[30-Aug-18 11:07 PM] Mylo#8306
``` komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE getinfo
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)``` gotta check log

yeah but that's what slows me down, reading thru all the z_ stuff!

[30-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Mylo#8306
address is listed.

[30-Aug-18 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Next z tx goes to queue

[30-Aug-18 11:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So only 1 z tx process at one time

[30-Aug-18 11:19 PM] Mylo#8306
ok.   i'll have to scroll up and get all the op-ids after rage-sending

[30-Aug-18 11:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Can’t send part of the mined coins in t address to z address
Has to send the whole utxo to z address

[30-Aug-18 11:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Z to z is usual

[30-Aug-18 11:20 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah all were z_shieldcoinbase "*" z_addr

[30-Aug-18 11:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Cool

[30-Aug-18 11:21 PM] Mylo#8306
prior to send

[30-Aug-18 11:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Wait for all z tx operations to finish 
Then check balance and try next
