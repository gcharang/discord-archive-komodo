$ARRR has some SOLID support at the 0.045 KMD range, looks pretty confidently to be the bottom

@grewalsatinder or @SHossain - can one of you guys find time to write a tech article on the Sapling benefits that directly make pirate stronger and how?

[01-Dec-18 09:25 PM] FishyGuts#5085

`Larimer` : Damn, I'm really excited about this new project Craig
`Wright` : I know what you mean, them suckers just love getting their asses handed to them by us
`Larimer` : You know, come to think of it, I measure our success much like pregnancy
`Wright` : What do you mean Dan, it's not like it took nine months to build these dog piles
`Larimer` : Well no, however, everyone congratulates us, especially the noobs, but nobody cares how many times we fucked them to achieve it

I can never get mergetoaddress to work so far

[01-Dec-18 10:12 PM] SHossain#0007
zmigrate will not be added into Agama

[01-Dec-18 10:12 PM] gets#8925
@jl777c will komodo have turnstile too? or can u keep using old z addresses

[01-Dec-18 10:13 PM] SHossain#0007

[01-Dec-18 10:18 PM] SHossain#0007
sapling addresses will be default

[01-Dec-18 10:21 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
They are asking that if you haven't migrated to a sapling address post Feb 15th. Will you still be able to after that date? Or are the funds going to be burnt.

[01-Dec-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
funds burnt if you dont move it to sapling

[01-Dec-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so zmigrate

[01-Dec-18 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
dont lose funds

[01-Dec-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sprout is too slow, the exchange is not able to process fast enough

[01-Dec-18 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
sprout must be phased out as fast as possible

[01-Dec-18 10:22 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Hopefully people are smart and we don't burn a bunch of coins.

[01-Dec-18 10:22 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

move sum funds... sell a kidney :trollface:

[01-Dec-18 11:38 PM] wookie#7663
So coins that somehow don't z migrate by the deadline. Is that in  a way similar to a coin "burn" this decreasing the total supply?

[01-Dec-18 11:42 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The coins will become unusable, yes

[01-Dec-18 11:43 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
As the sprout address will no longer work

[02-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Noxemo#5387
are there any instructions on how to zmigrate? My coins are in the Agama wallet

[02-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Zoroaster#5093
You guys should create a Sprout-to-Sapling tutorial or FAQ on Zmigrating for dummies like me.

[02-Dec-18 12:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
We are in the process of doing so. It will be released when the migration dAPP is ready :) don't stress just yet, you aren't able to do anything until after the 15th of Dec

[02-Dec-18 12:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
An article will be released with all the information

Perfect! Very good to hear thank you

[02-Dec-18 12:27 AM] Don King#8901
Will migration app include mergetoaddress function?

[02-Dec-18 12:28 AM] SHossain#0007
check the 2nd pinned post of this channel for an example

[02-Dec-18 12:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
No, it will be specifically for zmigrate

[02-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Zoroaster#5093
I seem to remember the Agama wallet that will allow to us hold Erc20 tokens will be version 44. If this is true will it be Sapling safe also?

[02-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Don King#8901
Ok, I need to mergetoaddress tons of coins first then

[02-Dec-18 12:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Actually I think I misunderstood what you were asking. I'm not sure of the technical details on how it will carry out the migrate and whether you'll need to merge beforehand.

Yes! That's what I was waiting to hear,  the step by step for dummies.  Dont worry the team always comes through and are very throrough in everything they do and are well perpared. It's just ourselves that have to be careful, be methodical and triple check every move, make copies of everything for yourself and you will be fine. If you have a question ask...there is great support here!

[02-Dec-18 06:28 AM] nackmaster#2726
well I'm glad i looked closer at all of the comments lol

[02-Dec-18 06:28 AM] nackmaster#2726
so we're waiting for 12-15 it sounds like

[02-Dec-18 06:28 AM] nackmaster#2726
and then we have until 2-15

[02-Dec-18 08:03 AM] tahoeminer#4362
quick question.... I know KMD transactions will be disabled during the upgrade, but will ARRR be effected as well?

[02-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Don King#8901
@NutellaLicka yes, my question to devs is if we have to mergetoaddress before we zmigrate to sapling, or can we use the migrate app ok with tons of utxo from PIRATE mining. Plenty of time to go, so no stress!

[02-Dec-18 09:26 AM] mrlynch#5735
@nackmaster that is correct

[02-Dec-18 09:27 AM] Don King#8901
Also, will we be able to merge multiple addresses into one sapling address with the migrate app

[02-Dec-18 09:28 AM] mrlynch#5735
correct @Don King

[02-Dec-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
@Don King zmigrate will migrate whatever sprout funds you have

{Reactions}
👍 

[02-Dec-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you mergetoaddress ahead of time, it will complete faster

[02-Dec-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont, it will take longer

[02-Dec-18 11:44 AM] Don King#8901

dumpers be dumpin' shortly after price was 0.000007+

[02-Dec-18 12:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
profit of .00000053 ($0.0022) / ARRR at current NH prices or .01619998 ($65.82) for that whole dump

[02-Dec-18 12:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
cost to mine: aprox .183396 ($745.12)

[02-Dec-18 12:54 PM] mrlynch#5735
at current NH prices & relatively low diff. (not average over 24H)

[02-Dec-18 12:55 PM] kp#3190
dumpers gon dump

[02-Dec-18 12:55 PM] mrlynch#5735
just not really worth it imho

[02-Dec-18 12:56 PM] mrlynch#5735
those numbers are based on the presumption that the 30k was mined in the past hour. over a 24H period the actual profits would decrease (increase in net diff)

[02-Dec-18 12:56 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
if you mine all of it and not dump dumpster be gone

[02-Dec-18 12:57 PM] kp#3190
i calculated that we need like $11k daily to sustain miners dumping it all

[02-Dec-18 12:57 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
even if you mine only most of it mining price will grow that much dumpsters will not dump cheap

[02-Dec-18 12:57 PM] kp#3190
its still more profitable than zcash to dump

[02-Dec-18 12:57 PM] kp#3190
so 🤷

[02-Dec-18 01:11 PM] mrlynch#5735
there's only 1 direction from $0.028 BTC price and that's going to be up, especially after sapling

[02-Dec-18 01:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
so... just mine, buy & hodl

[02-Dec-18 01:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
and ... only shy of 4 months until 1st halving so it would be wise to have a bag stashed away for at least 6 months
