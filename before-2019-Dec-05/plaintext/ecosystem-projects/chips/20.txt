[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> ```For Player id: 0, cards: diamonds-->four     hearts-->six     diamonds-->two     hearts-->ace     clubs-->king     diamonds-->queen     diamonds-->seven```

[03-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Why you have 7 cards

[03-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If I folded on turn

[03-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Shouldn't it be 4 + 2 ?

[03-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> first two are hole cards...

[03-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> next five are community cards..

[03-Jan-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> But we didn't see 5th card

[03-Jan-19 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> since you folded before the river card....and the number of active players is only 1....

[03-Jan-19 04:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> the hand will get evaluated and awarded me the winner...

[03-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> actually I should display these logs also at the folded players terminal too...

[03-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> No, if everybody fold

[03-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> You shouldn't reveal cards of player who won

[03-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Yassin IndéNodes> true

[03-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And player who won shouldn't see cards which nobody else saw

[03-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Like a river in our last dealt

[03-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay...so the river card should never be dealt?

[03-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Correct

[03-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay...I'll correct that..

[03-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> whenever a round ends and a player wins, then no extra cards are shown

[03-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> unless the player wants to, but only his own cards

[03-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763

```

[03-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> I guess no such complexity as showing by player wish needed now

[03-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> But just my imho

[03-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> no, that complexity is for later

[03-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @SHossain are you on poker branch of bet

[03-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> same goes for the turn (card before the river), if after the flop someone bets and everyone else folds, then the turn and river are not shown

[03-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> no. i just followed the guide https://github.com/sg777/bet/blob/poker/README.md

[03-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> watch some games on youtube to get a feeling

[03-Jan-19 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yeah and if everybody fold preflop

[03-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> No community cards revealing at all

[03-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And no rake taken

[03-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> git checkout poker..

[03-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and can you please try..

[03-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> rake is another thing sg probably didn't account for yet

[03-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> ```error { "code" : 206, "message" : "Fee 1000 is 2.941176% of payment 34000; max fee requested is 0.500000%"```

[03-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Isn't it connected to rake?

[03-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh it's just txfee maybe

[03-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @sg777 same result with `poker` branch

[03-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> that's something with the LN...I posted in LN community for that how much minimum fee we can hardcode...I'll soon fix that..

[03-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @SHossain can you please run again...

[03-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> one more thing is did you pulled the latest changes from the lightning and chips master branches?

[03-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I didn't know about `rake`, I'll read about it...

[03-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> everything compiled in the last 30 minutes from latest source

[03-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> one more doubt is, for example if all the players folds expect one...in that case does the player cards should be revealed at the end of the game...or the dealer simply reward the single remaining player without revealing any of the cards?

[03-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If everybody folds except of 1 player - he winning pot and no need to show his cards

[03-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> look, this is a list of several tournaments. almost every tournament has a different setup: how much rake, how much the blinds are, when the blinds go higher

[03-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> those are table properties

[03-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @SHossain  strange, can you please run again?

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and those need to be programmed somehow

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> sure

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> @jorian better to check cash tables list

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763

```

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> true, but it's the same idea

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> there needs to be a table layer

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> this is what i see on lightning output
```
2019-01-03T17:04:12.202Z lightningd(9232): Connected json input
2019-01-03T17:04:12.202Z lightningd(9232):jcon fd 15: Success
```

[03-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and on top of the table layer, a tournament layer
