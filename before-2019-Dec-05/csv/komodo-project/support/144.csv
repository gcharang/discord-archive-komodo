After struggling with the instructions and thinking I was an idiot because no server would work, I downloaded the Utrum wallet (thanks to @Deleted User ), entered my compromised seed, and my KMD was there.

I'm beginning to think that wallets are almost as risky as storing on an exchange. The exception is hard wallets. The little dab of money I'm making from interest by keeping funds on different wallets is not worth the risk for me. Perhaps I'll gain more trust down road.";"";"";
