don't use the old version of Agama
Verus version of Agama is safe to use, but doesn't have RFOX yet (they might add it in the future)
Currently, you need to use Native mode(qt-wallet) to move RFOX: https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029971-launching-pirate-rfox-and-other-assetchains-in-komodo-ocean-mac-
If you don't need to move them, just backup the seed and wait for a lite wallet to be available: either in Verus-Agama or a wallet by RFOX team";"";"";

This may be partly my fault for changing the 'to wallet' address at the last moment but I did mention both amounts in my original claim form.
