Elections are not cryptoeconomically secure. 

Once you abandon cryptoeconomically security, it is easy to process transactions super fast.

If we can see an attack for what it is, we don't have to worry about money being stolen. The worst that can happen is a hard fork. But hard forking will obviously disrupt financial transactions for a certain amount of time, until people are migrated to the truthful chain. How much damage can this cause? We don't know. It's up to every person transacting at the moment. The higher the deposit required, the higher the fee will be, obviously.
