But, I don't understand how Liquidation occurs?

If KMD drops below a certain level, someone else can step in and liquidate (buy KUSD likely at a discount)? and a reduced amount of KMD is returned to the original account, while 5% goes to a global reserve account? What does the liquidator receive for the KUSD that's going to get burned?

I lock KMD to get KUSD. I use the KUSD to buy KMD on the Market. I then lock this KMD to get more KUSD. Rinse and Repeat.

Is there protection built-in? For instance, not allowing 100% LOCK-IN? Otherwise creation of Money is endless?

I suppose if you locked in 100% and KMD dropped 1%, you'd risk being liquidated, so maybe that's the protection?";"";"";
