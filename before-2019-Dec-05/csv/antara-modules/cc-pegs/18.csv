Now that signing is in mempool, it often happens that nodes start signing withdraw at the same time and they create a separate sign txs both with one sign and spending the same utxo from withdraw. Then one of them gets mined but the other that is not mined stays still in wallet of the node which created it and every next block it is trying to add it to mempool. I think we have to address this problem that when the chain tip moves every tx that refers to unspent utxo should be discarded. I don't know if this will break something, and maybe someone made it like it is now at some point!";"";"";
