The fix consists of pubkey spoofing check so you can only register for pubkey you own. Before register now there is another tx - oraclefund, which funds pubkeys oracles CC address with 10k sat and then on register it spends that amount to pubkeys normal address ( so it is back to the user). Also I've added oraclessamples to show mempool data.";"";"👍 (1)";

If you create a tx manually (without RPC) that sends this vout to someone else baton, but for this you need to have his private key so basically not possible.";"";"";
