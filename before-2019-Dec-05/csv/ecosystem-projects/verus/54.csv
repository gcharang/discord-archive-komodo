"455021680935436290";"Gateway#3763";"08-Nov-18 06:34 PM";"[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> It should list 100 addresses that are in your keypool. When you created your wallet, you got all of those assigned, and they are yours. This is because Verus uses default keypool size of 100 (just like zcash), which means when your wallet gets created, 100 R-addresses are generated just for you and stored in the wallet. If you solo mine, your rewards will eventually land on those addresses. Thats just how the wallet is designed, it starts with 100 semi-hidden addresses despite showing you just one in Agama Receive tab. WIF is not exacly a private key, it's a way to present them in a nice way so that they could be easily copied and moved around. But it translates to you private key indeed, its just another way of representing your original private key. Check up https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format";"";"";

Not sure if you know who Emin Gun Sirer is or have noticed this:
https://twitter.com/VerusCoin/status/1060740979714486272
I see his offer to render an opinion on a proof sketch of our consensus algorithms a big opportunity for Verus Coin recognition.

As a community project with fair launch and no ICO, we don't pour money into marketing, and I believe that our path to success in the long run is to build, rather than talk about, better solutions and a more secure and scalable system that proves itself in the real world and with real use cases over time.  To make progress, our focus so far has been on creating the platform solutions that lay the foundation for each next step, but we have not devoted resources to academically/formally proving the systems we have invented beyond proving their correctness to ourselves, advisers, and other community members. Before now, we considered formalizing such proofs as time and energy that may not actually benefit the project more than building the next advance or solution. With Emin Gun Sirer, one of the most respected experts in fintech and crypto, willing to look at our proof sketch when it's finished, we've added that as a high priority item to the work list, and it will take some work to complete. I'm actually very excited about that as our first real opportunity to get broad recognition for our real contributions to improving fundamental consensus algorithms. The people who will be paying attention to his opinions are experts who others pay attention to and represent many orders of magnitude more investment capital than the entire Verus market cap, I'm sure.";"";"";
