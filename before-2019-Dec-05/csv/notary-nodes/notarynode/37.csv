This year i will periodically give out objective recommendations based on what a NN operator did for the KMD ecosystem but also based on the skillz level and professionalism. I will start with two community members that have been around for more than a year now - this will be the 2nd NN era in which we are happy to have them on board. 

@blackjok3r and @Alright are two very active and supportive Devs, IT experts and Blockchain architects. They have launched up an ecosystem project called #kmdlabs and thanks to their efforts a set of various bugs and issues was fixed on the Notary Node Network but also in the Komodo Blockchain network. Having each of them run a set of Notary Nodes across the globe and hopefully in each region is highly recommended for the stability and security of our network.";"";"👆 (7),labs (13)";
