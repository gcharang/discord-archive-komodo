"458262320775430155";"kolo#1111";"27-Jun-18 04:57 PM";"everyone Here is time to update your nodes. You will have to do the following:

1. Update codebase of komodo to the latest dev/beta
2. Run assetchains and new asset named RFOX will appear.
3. Import your kmdwif privkey to RFOX chain `./fiat/rfox importprivkey xxxxxx`. You will have 0.999 RFOX.
4. Install veruscoin daemon:
`https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/tree/dev`
dev branch works perfectly for me. Install is 100% straightforward. README has steps (`git pull`, `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`), but they are totally equal to komodod, no additional library or reinstalling packages
5. Run veruscoin. It's the only complication, because it should be run using this:
`~/VerusCoin/src/komodod -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_veruspos=50 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -addnode=185.25.48.236 -addnode=185.64.105.111`
Notice that it's using komodod binary from veruscoin repo, not usual one. Be careful if you have komodod systemwide.
Next operations with  VRCS can be done as usually, by `komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC` and `./fiat/vrsc`
6.  Import kmdwif to veruscoin - `./fiat/vrsc importprivkey` - you will have 0.999 VRSC.
7. Update iguana and do everything else as usually.
8. Please, monitor your assets and PM me when refill is needed
