I don't know enough about Blockchain coding to even suggest an alternative and I assume someone would have already done so if one were available.
I have already spent about .25 BTC on costs I'll never see back so we will run as hard as we can, but this is not very ideal from any standpoint, and other than ""following the code"" arguments, I don't see how anyone could agree with the morals of it.
