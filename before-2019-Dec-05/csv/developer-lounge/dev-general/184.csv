Your keys never touch the internet ever. I've been talking w Airgap for integration of Komodo + reward claim + assetchain and will proceed with it. It would be even better to have this natively available for Agama or the future wallet : https://airgap.it/
You only need an old smartphone with app for creating, holding and signing w your seed and a qr code reader, never connect it.
1.Use the online wallet to create a raw transaction, show qr code
2.Read qr code with offline smartphone, sign it and show qr code of signed tx
3.Online wallet imports the signed tx via qr code & cam
4.Send tx";"";"😍 (3),🙏 (1),💪 (2)";
