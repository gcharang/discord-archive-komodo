I had an idea today about how we pay 10% of coinbase to a multisig address. Currently that means that address is going to fill with utxos of 1 coin in size when it comes the the notary payout ... we will need to merge these utxos before making payment... being a multi sig tx (and likley a manual process at first) this will be a bit annoying>
I was wondering if you could have a rule instead where it only paid such amounts each 100th block so 100 coins when `nHeight % 100` is true (I htink thats how you do it)";"";"";
