well it's not just that
it's that upstream would have very different momom code
and the point of LABS is to test KMD stuff, so we want to stay as close as possible to KMD's codebase
blackjok3rToday at 1:50 PM
If we revert tokens and launch... When that code is done it will hardfork our chain
AlrightToday at 1:50 PM
if we don't have it's features to test, it's not very useful

Hi, There is something really important that needs to be done.
We need to get `How Labs Works` clearly defined.oss
This is what new projects, tester and investors want/need to know when they first come to Labs.  It'll save much hassle answering the same questions again and again.
It needs an basic outline, like the diagram `https://kmdlabs.com/how-kmdlabs-works/` (bottom).
Need to add at least one example case for project coming in.
