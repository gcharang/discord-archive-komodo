We are a small group shouting “wow Komodo is great” against their believers.  As of now we’re barely mentioned and have more skeptics against us than the supporters who stand with us.  In short, we need marketing but apparently that isn’t on the table until after the beta 😭";"";"";

The people who have sold to help reach this point of an ATL sat price despite all the developments.  We are nearly bottom of the barrel with price and not even in top 50.  And yes, at THIS POINT where we are in the beta with the live version on the horizon it is about marketing.  We’ve got enough “created value” but not enough eyes on it.  What developments are in the pipeline that are going to create value exponentially enough from where we are now?  From following for the past few years it seems like we’re at the point where value is created but we need the proper mass adoption";"";"";

The app alone will bring more revenue to Komodo than any other product it has launched before. It will also garner the support of dozens of communities and leverage their marketing power as well.";"";"";
"83746401896366080";"grumpygoron#4320";"19-Sep-19 04:39 PM";"It’s not an easy button but a process, I agree.  And Atomicdex is phenomenal but to your point it’s not like we’ll launch it and all of a sudden there will be more revenue.  You can’t market without a product and you can’t have adoption to a product without marketing.  I think I’d just like to see more of a balance between the two but it was recently mentioned there won’t be a push until after beta.  Seems like a good time to push for more buzz.  I don’t know what happens behind the scenes but I thought there were people hired for specifically marketing reasons, my bad if I’m wrong and that’d make much more sense";"";"";
