I'm expecting btc to break down a bit from here, and eth to break down a bit more.... basically a correction in ethbtc and altbtc pairs that are strongly correlated to bitcoin. KMD however is a strange beast, and looking at KMDETH we are at support and seem to be holding. 

Seems somewhat probable that ETH may drop and KMD holds this zone and begins another triangle/sideways correction of sorts... I'm definitely not counting out a slow bleed either, BTC is basically doing that atm... for btc - too many longs open, we need a decent shake down before upside IMO, all their stops are so obvious too, should be a good volume down spike incoming IMO.
