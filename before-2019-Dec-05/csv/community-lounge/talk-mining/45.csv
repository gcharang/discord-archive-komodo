I would like to explain a little concept based on who belive in a project like KMD and not only for REWARD as you said 

1% of fee on my pool is 0,03 KMD  at every block , after 100 block my earn after a year and a half is 3 KMD, about 80/90 KMD at month if pool is lucky.
i have 4 servers with dedicated infrastructure for KMD some with more than 4 cpus and 8 GB that each  that costs more than 80/90 KMD at month.
Image when kmd was at minus than 0,4$ last year with half and half of blocks found...
Without considering time to dedicate on it.

A pool fee it's just like to say ""hey man thank you for your time! ""

I was the one that told him that, and please don't take it personally, but I have strong viewpoints against the usage of pools in the modern era (especially as it concerns centralization and miners seeking pure profits with no specific regard to the coin in question).
Conversely, from the standpoint of a purely economic scale, I 1/2 hope that **everyone** else joins public pools and I can grow 1-2% faster than they can.";"";"👌 (1)";
