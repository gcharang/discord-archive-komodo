Sticking to Kevin Smith then...

[18-Dec-19 08:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
In an interview, Kevin admits to doing something illegal (technically) in order to finance his first film...  two part question need to answer both... HOW was Clerks paid for, and what lie made it possible?

[18-Dec-19 08:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
i may have to step away so I am DMing @Dr.Terminus  the answers

[18-Dec-19 08:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
good question!

[18-Dec-19 08:22 PM] Oszy#5734
Hmm

[18-Dec-19 08:22 PM] crumb#2550
it was paid by credit cards and it was filmed during the night

[18-Dec-19 08:23 PM] Oszy#5734
He sold his comic books

[18-Dec-19 08:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
Not quite the lie

[18-Dec-19 08:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
Nope

[18-Dec-19 08:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
The last part may be obscure... I only ever heard him admit this part once in a podcast or audio interbiew...

[18-Dec-19 08:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
but its a super important detail nonetheless

[18-Dec-19 08:27 PM] Oszy#5734
Pass then 游때

[18-Dec-19 08:28 PM] Oszy#5734
Don't know and don't want to Google cheat 游때

[18-Dec-19 08:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill once again defer to @Dr.Terminus for a time limit... if no one else answers the second part, @crumb  got the first half correct, which is public knowledge... Smith even thanked both credut cards by name via tweet the day they added Clerks to the Congressional Library last week

[18-Dec-19 08:34 PM] crumb#2550
was it the fact that he enrolled into film class to get a discount and immediately dropped out once he used the student discount to rent equipment?

[18-Dec-19 08:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats a good tidbit but not the one I know... where did you see that part?

[18-Dec-19 08:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
and thats so like him

[18-Dec-19 08:34 PM] crumb#2550
in an interview

[18-Dec-19 08:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
while good and in character... not illegal

So he built up a supply of ten credit cards with $2,000 limits, and maxed them all out. Clerks많rossed $3 million in theaters. Kevin Smith's low-budget film

[18-Dec-19 08:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
OK so im trying to find a link with proof but even that is not coming up... so ill say crumb has it @Dr.Terminus

[18-Dec-19 08:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill find it for my own peace of mind...

[18-Dec-19 08:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
But in that interview he talks about getting all those CCs as a joke with a friend to see who could get more...

[18-Dec-19 08:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
and he admits to lying to the creditors on the apps... that at the vid store he makes 50K a year and when they called it was him answering, acting as the manager and confirming that he did indeed make $50K a year at that store

[18-Dec-19 09:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[18-Dec-19 09:00 PM] crumb#2550

[18-Dec-19 09:00 PM] crumb#2550
thanks @Dr.Terminus !

[18-Dec-19 09:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
more to come, try to gather a few more folks and we'll do another next few days, leading up to holidays / through new year

[18-Dec-19 09:01 PM] crumb#2550
christmas through new year season in perfect for this stuff.

[18-Dec-19 09:02 PM] crumb#2550
i think there was trivia like this last year also

[18-Dec-19 09:02 PM] crumb#2550
very nice

[18-Dec-19 09:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yeah def! This weekend and on should have lots of peeps here

[18-Dec-19 09:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
Isnt there a trivia Discord bot?

[18-Dec-19 09:02 PM] Oszy#5734
Lets get a trivia channel

[18-Dec-19 09:02 PM] Oszy#5734
There is

[18-Dec-19 09:03 PM] crumb#2550
we are on it are we not?

[18-Dec-19 09:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yeah lets make that happen

[18-Dec-19 09:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I almost formally requested a trivia chan, thought this cryptopuzzle was most suitable of what already existed

[18-Dec-19 09:03 PM] Oszy#5734
I'd leave this for actual crypto puzzles

[18-Dec-19 09:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
at times there will be puzzles / riddles

[18-Dec-19 09:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
others trivia

[18-Dec-19 09:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
will have to bounce between rooms.. not a big deal though

[18-Dec-19 09:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or just make a live events/ games chan of sorts to cover all such sessions

[18-Dec-19 09:05 PM] crumb#2550
puzzles with occasional trivia would be fine. there are so many channels already

[18-Dec-19 09:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
leave cryptopuzzle for true long term / pinned puzzles only

[18-Dec-19 09:05 PM] crumb#2550
ok, that works also

[18-Dec-19 09:05 PM] crumb#2550
was fun playing. laters!

[18-Dec-19 09:06 PM] Oszy#5734
Take care mate

[18-Dec-19 09:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
