Ok re caretaker nodes thanks.

Now, I’ve read more of the ticket but not all, I have a question about the p2p orderbook and the order matching as separate items.

1) from my understanding that the orderbook data structure is an array that can be used by front ends, is the orderbook data structure (essentially a look up directory) re-usable in other real-time P2P data applications that are not orderbooks.  Can this be put on the roadmap?

2) the ordermatching is two parties agreeing to execute “something”.  In the Dex app, a trade.  However in another P2P app it could execute another something, eg signal to open a comms channel with other software like VoIP - is the execution some data structure/protocol  instruction, eg json ?

3) going back to orderbook network, can a node connect to specific caretaker nodes like with -addnode or -connect?  This question is more related to (2) for uses in other apps rather than trading, but maybe it’s already doable with nSPV in the coins.json file?

[01-Jan-20 06:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Would this have  have any use for a lightweight block explorer?
Something to ```circumvent the issue of having a single point of view (a single full node) to view the chain``` as mentioned in this article `https://medium.com/the-arcadia-media-group/building-lightweight-block-explorers-using-pokt-46baf668625e`?

[01-Jan-20 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
1) there is no orderbook data structure. it is arbitrary data that is propagated to all nodes quickly, but with minimum wasted bandwidth. you can make it a general chat "room", where each datablob is a message. by adding qualifiers to it, you can create "channels". really, it can do whatever you can make arbitrary data do.

[01-Jan-20 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
2) the datablob is a blob of data, its purpose can be anything. think of it as a global broadcast into RAM, for temporary things. of course, you can add logging to a node and make it permanent, but that is not its focus. the goal is a realtime feed that is 99.9% the same to 99.9% of the nodes 99.9% of the time, created by a fully decentralized p2p network

[01-Jan-20 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
3) you can, but each DEX network will sync globally to all the data (for the past hour). i imagine there can be hundreds of different DEX networks, each with a different purpose

[01-Jan-20 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@CrisF if there is a node that has the data and is submitting it to the DEX network, then yes, but explorers are more for long term and this is designed for realtime. a realtime streaming would be more suited. at first i didnt worry about throughput so much, so it is limited to 20 tx/second sustained, but after i finished the optimizations, it should be able to handle 1000 tx/second or more

overnight the small scale stress test did over a million tx. i had to slow it down due to some race conditions

Great thanks for taking it back to data blob, that rocks

Yep keen to enquire more about (3) in the future for exchange of other data, cheers

[01-Jan-20 08:54 AM] Slyris#2880
When you say race conditions you speak about multithreading @jl777c ?

What is your current threading model ?

[01-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i fixed the bug

[01-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810

[01-Jan-20 07:33 PM] SHossain#0007
just launched all chains with fresh data dir. 0 peers now. maybe need to wait a bit before they get connected.

[01-Jan-20 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, some specific addnodes to get connections going is a good idea

[01-Jan-20 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
after the peers.dat finds the relevant peers, it will do it automatically on restart but when bootstrapping a network, it is often a bit of a pain

[01-Jan-20 07:36 PM] jl777c#5810
you also want each node to have random peers

[01-Jan-20 07:37 PM] SHossain#0007
i have 2 `addnode=xx.xx.x.x` entries in each conf file

[01-Jan-20 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
that should trickle out the peers

[01-Jan-20 07:38 PM] jl777c#5810
check how many connections in each peer

[01-Jan-20 07:38 PM] SHossain#0007

[01-Jan-20 07:42 PM] SHossain#0007
daemons within same servers should find peers easily

[01-Jan-20 07:43 PM] SHossain#0007
in addition to addnode= in conf file, there is one `-addnode=` param in the chain start command

[01-Jan-20 07:44 PM] jl777c#5810
does that node see any peers?

[01-Jan-20 07:44 PM] SHossain#0007
nope

[01-Jan-20 07:45 PM] SHossain#0007
stopping all instances and will start only 2

[01-Jan-20 07:45 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
are the peers using the same ports?

[01-Jan-20 07:46 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
`66.70.180.46:13995 failed after select()`
66.70.180.46 will fail like that if it's not using 13995

[01-Jan-20 07:47 PM] SHossain#0007
there are 32+32 nodes on 2 servers. on a single server all daemons using different port + different rpcport that matches on the 2nd server

[01-Jan-20 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
it worked before and i had many peers on single daemon. i.e.: 24, 32

[01-Jan-20 07:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i used your script to generate those custom datadir for all instances

[01-Jan-20 07:50 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, try the latest, we can just ignore that it will have many peers

[01-Jan-20 07:50 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
I never tried to connect them, I just made it start up 😛

[01-Jan-20 07:56 PM] SHossain#0007
now, i'm getting connections

[01-Jan-20 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the bitcoin peering code has a mind of its own and it seems hard to give it a specific target of peers...

[01-Jan-20 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
when i launched with latest, it just found all

[01-Jan-20 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
once all the peers are connected to the network, the DEX_broadcast should cause a print in all nodes

[01-Jan-20 07:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so each node has 60 peers?

[01-Jan-20 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
27 actually

[01-Jan-20 07:57 PM] SHossain#0007
out of 32

[01-Jan-20 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
from another server

[01-Jan-20 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so 32 nodes total?

[01-Jan-20 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
in a single server, yes. on the other server, i didn't yet launch all chains

[01-Jan-20 07:58 PM] SHossain#0007
now, i'll have max 60

[01-Jan-20 07:58 PM] jl777c#5810
ok

[01-Jan-20 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
one idea is that after the network is up and running, restarting a single node with -maxconnections=8

[01-Jan-20 07:59 PM] jl777c#5810
then make sure it starts up with 8 peers

[01-Jan-20 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if that works, then iterate through the other peers. at some point it wont be able to get a full 8 peers, but maybe it can work to reduce the connectivity in this way

[01-Jan-20 08:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but before doing that, lets make sure the DEX_broadcast works

[01-Jan-20 08:02 PM] SHossain#0007

DEXpurge.145 for t.xxx -> n.0

[01-Jan-20 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
that means for timeslot 145 at the unixtimestamp, it purged 0 packets

[01-Jan-20 08:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this makes sense as you need to run 59 minutes before anything will be purged.

[01-Jan-20 08:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the rightmost part of L.8 A.1 coll.0 is the performance stats of the internal hashtable for recent requests. L is the number of lookups, A.1 is the number of additions to the hashtable and coll is the number of collisions

[01-Jan-20 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
each collision will likely create a bit of redundant data transmission, that is why this is being tracked. my results show about a 0.1% collision rate, which is small enough to not matter as the goal is less than 20% redundant packets

[01-Jan-20 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
now the middle part is what has the most important data

[01-Jan-20 08:05 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess the `total.x` is the  number of request

[01-Jan-20 08:05 PM] jl777c#5810
total.1 is the total number of packets that are in the RAM (sum of all timeslots)

[01-Jan-20 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the e59... is a combination of all the shorthashes (least 32 bits of actual hash XOR), given N packets, if it generates the same combination of shorthashes, odds are very good that the data is 100% in sync

[01-Jan-20 08:06 PM] jl777c#5810
R.1 S.0 A.1 duplicates.0

[01-Jan-20 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
R.1 is the number of packets received

[01-Jan-20 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
S.0 is the number of packets sent

[01-Jan-20 08:07 PM] jl777c#5810
A.1 is the number of packets added to the RAM. until purging starts, this should match the earlier total

[01-Jan-20 08:08 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. that's matching

[01-Jan-20 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810
and the duplicates.0 is the number of duplicate packets received. this is what needs to be below 20%. the higher the connectivity in a network, the higher the duplicates percentage will be

[01-Jan-20 08:08 PM] jl777c#5810

currently it is just making random data packets and is for throughput validation

[01-Jan-20 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
once we can verify that it can indeed handle 8192 tx/sec, then i can enable the txpow. for now a small number of nodes can simulate 100000x the nodes when txpow is active

[01-Jan-20 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810
well, maybe the leverage is only 10,000x

[01-Jan-20 08:13 PM] jl777c#5810
on my low powered nodes it is only a 1000x leverage, but on a faster system, the fixed overhead will be much smaller
