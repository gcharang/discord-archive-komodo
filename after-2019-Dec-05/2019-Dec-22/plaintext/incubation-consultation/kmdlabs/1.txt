. wait... this was NN? Probably wallet.dat my staking node took aboiut that long too

[21-Dec-19 12:03 AM] bishop#9773
I don't stake on the NN, wallet is 2.5MB

[21-Dec-19 12:05 AM] bishop#9773
Sweet, two notas

[21-Dec-19 12:08 AM] bishop#9773
But I'll start staking on it for the hell of it.

[21-Dec-19 12:09 AM] blackjok3r#3181
you can for sure, shouldnt make any diffrence.

[21-Dec-19 12:30 AM] bishop#9773
`stats.py` in py_scripts not work? Specify LABS and 1440 blocks and I return blank

[21-Dec-19 12:33 AM] blackjok3r#3181
will check.. its a new script, and there have been some changes to things. Its using GetNotarizationsFromBlock rpc.. .try calling that from cli itarating back from current block height to see if it returns anything?

[21-Dec-19 12:41 AM] bishop#9773

[LABS:288309] 342s until elegible...
288309 Aint your block either HOMIE!!!
[LABS:288309] Chain advanced, reset staking loop.

[21-Dec-19 01:52 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
I  think  this means  it solved  the problem and  is waiting to be  eligible to submit so  it can  claim   the  block

[21-Dec-19 01:54 AM] kmdkrazy#8280
so  it  is  mining  / solving the problem  before it says the  output 2019-12-21 01:08:00 Running KomodoMiner.tromp with 4 transactions in block (92689 bytes)

[21-Dec-19 06:49 AM] blackjok3r#3181
I am about to test this, the RPC and the conf file settings work, need to confirm it does what you requested please. 
Just building blackjok3r branch and trying to stake 1 block will confirm, pretty sure its simple enough nothing can go wrong, dont kill me if you lose coins 😄

[21-Dec-19 07:01 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
OK - on a staking node (ONLY Staking) - what are the params to set in order to have new generated coins go to an exisiting address OTHER than the pubkey?

[21-Dec-19 07:03 AM] blackjok3r#3181 (pinned)
`./komodod -ac_cclib=labs -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=80.240.17.222 -addnode=103.6.12.112 -addnode=149.28.8.219 -ac_ccenable=226,236 -ac_supply=350689 -ac_staked=51 -ac_name=LABS -ac_reward=0,0,800000000 -ac_end=128,10080,0 -ac_notarypay=64,100000000,1000000000 -ac_eras=3 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_cc=101 -ac_halving=129,1 -ac_decay=0,100000000,100000000 -splitperc=100`
this will merge the entire value of the staking utxo to the coinbase vout 0 (using -pubkey will send ALL staking utxo to -pubkey address/segid)
blackjok3rr branch has an extra param
`-returntosegid=1` 
This sends the coinbase to the address that staked the block. So your segid distribution will stay the same.

[21-Dec-19 07:55 AM] phm87#7395
Since the hard fork, I'm seeing weird tx on my staking node:

Is `-splitperc=50` functional with `-returntosegid=1` ?

[21-Dec-19 08:47 AM] blackjok3r#3181
only in blackjok3r branch and I have not tested it yet, just had visitor

[21-Dec-19 08:48 AM] blackjok3r#3181
if it confirmed ok by me and a few others I will make PR with just that commit nto master for review

[21-Dec-19 08:56 AM] blackjok3r#3181
@phm87  
I dont quite follow your screen shot there, but it looks as if they are staking tx that are being reorged ?

[21-Dec-19 08:57 AM] blackjok3r#3181
any chance you can get a `getrawtransaction` for them and send me pls?

[21-Dec-19 09:22 AM] penguin of $ETHO#0544

the 'why' is still vague in that text

[21-Dec-19 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢#7004
the "why" is:
if you don't create a block then the required UTXO isn't spent and you're not screwed by the protocol like before

[21-Dec-19 01:45 PM] jorian#4555
right

joker : yes you are correct, there was a reorg or some orphans that's why there is ``-1`` in the confirmation column in my printscreen. I'll show you other printscreens of my staking nodes to show you: more than 30 hours ago, it didn't send tx of 0 value but since 30 hours, it sends tx of 0 value (to no address ?) when it stake a block. This LABS node is only staking and not mining, I'm using yiimp webpages to display tx and infos retrieved from the coin daemon (and this part is opensource in PHP)
